She admitted that she had struggled with thoughts of suicide in the past and wrote a song about it. \"I feel ashamed that I would have those thoughts, feel that low and that depressed,\" she said. \"You can be right or you can be loved. I just want to be loved.\"\n\nDuring the session, Perry was seen crying and mascara running down her face as she opened up about her past struggles. Dr. Singh described the session as \"captivating and emotional\" and said that he was surprised by how open and vulnerable Perry was. \"The whole session was about the dichotomy of the conflict between her professional persona of Katy Perry and her individual human life of Katherine Hudson,\" he said. \"At the end, she said that she was going to integrate them.\"\n\nAfter the session, Perry was seen leaving with a wooden bowl filled with a fresh stack of Angel Cards, which appeared to give her exactly what she was looking for: \"Freedom.\" Her 72-hour \"Witness World Wide\" YouTube special is running through Monday and culminates in a free concert for a select group of fans.

He is still protected by 'family members' in Brazil. They've told lies to papers to try to silence me. To finally speak out and not be afraid. To everyone still suffering silently, you never asked for it. NOBODY DOES. I do this for my son. So that he will see one day that we all have a voice. And that this behavior can not be tolerated any longer.\"\n\nThe actress, who plays Effy Stonem in the show, revealed that she kept her assault a secret for a decade, only sharing her story with her son.\n\nBut in a recent interview with Metro.Co.UK, Scodelario revealed that the response to her bravery had been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nShe said: \"The response was wonderful. I am now dealing with a new side of it, which is this. I will be asked about it forever now. I hope it doesn't define me but it will always be under my name and I accept that – but I am proud I was brave enough to do it and I am grateful for the support I had from friends.\"\n\nScodelario also revealed that her 12-year-old self was the driving force behind her decision to speak out.\n\nShe said: \"I remember thinking that if I was 12-years-old and I had this horrific thing happen to me but I saw a woman I admired speaking up about it, it would have made me feel less guilty, and it would have inspired me to think 'this won't hold me back, this is something that has happened but I am not a victim.' So I thought if I can do that for one person then I owe it to my 12-year-old self.\"\n\nScodelario joins a growing list of women who have bravely come forward with their own stories of abuse, as the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across the world.\n\nActress Michelle Williams brought #MeToo founder Tarana Burke to the Golden Globes and opened up about navigating the uncertain times to help create a better world for the next generation, including her own 12-year-old daughter, Matilda Rose Ledger.\n\n\"I thought I would have to raise my daughter to learn how to protect herself in a dangerous world, but I think the work that Tarana has done and the work that I'm learning how to do — we actually have the opportunity to hand our children a different world,\" Williams said on the E! red carpet pre-show. \"I am honored beyond measure to be standing next to this woman.

Stefani was wearing a white bikini top and a black sarong, while Shelton was wearing a blue trucker hat and board shorts.\n\nWhile they may have been an unexpected couple at first, Shelton and Stefani have been going strong for some time now. The source noted that the couple often visits Shelton's house in Oklahoma, where they spend time with Stefani's three sons from her previous marriage to Gavin Rossdale. Shelton acts as a father figure to the children and enjoys introducing them to country life.\n\nThe source also revealed that Shelton is devoted to Stefani and feels that everything in life happens for a reason. Although he was previously married to Miranda Lambert, he is now happy with the family he has with Stefani.

Us has rounded up the best online reactions.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt on Monday, September 19, citing irreconcilable differences.

Little did they know, Meghan was one of the hopeful dog owners.\n\nGuy's journey didn't end there.

Harry, Meghan's fiancé, recalled in their first interview together, \"For 33 years, I’ve been barked at, and this one walks in, and absolutely nothing, just wagging tails.\"\n\nTomorrow, Guy will be by Meghan's side again as they walk down the aisle in one of the most important moments of their lives.

He even delighted the crowd with a back flip during the show. After the performance, Michelle Visage, the drag race panelist, shared a photograph of herself embracing Garfield and Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox, captioning it with pride, \"Andrew Garfield, you are my new friend, I am SO proud of you for not just lip syncing Whitney tonight in a wig no less, but for opening your mind and heart to all it has to offer.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Garfield has donned drag.

On Monday, September 17, viewers will be treated to a night of emotional recognition as the winners are announced.\n\nThe major awards are divided into two categories: comedy and drama. On the drama side, The Handmaid's Tale, the freshman series that took home several awards in its first year, is once again in the running for Outstanding Drama Series. The grim, dystopian adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel was praised for its Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series. Additionally, the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series prize will be awarded to series star Elisabeth Moss, who has finally won an Emmy after seven prior nominations.\n\nOn the comedy side, the nominations field is crowded with eight series vying for the main prize. However, reigning champ Veep is missing as the show's final season was delayed while its star, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, underwent treatment for cancer. Among the contenders for the Outstanding Comedy Series throne are newcomer The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and the second season of Donald Glover's Atlanta. The rest of the Outstanding Comedy Series nominees include Barry, GLOW, Silicon Valley, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nWhile some shows were overlooked in certain categories, Killing Eve's star, Sandra Oh, made history as the first woman of Asian descent to be nominated for a Lead Actress Emmy.\n\nNBC will broadcast the 2018 Emmy Awards show live on Monday, with Saturday Night Live's Colin Jost and Michael Che hosting. The complete list of nominees can be found on the Emmys' website.\n\nAs the night of recognition approaches, let us take a moment to reflect on the emotional impact of television. From the laughter and tears that come with binge-watching a new show to the heartbreak and hope that comes with watching a character's journey unfold, television has the power to bring us together in a way that no other medium can.\n\nHere's to the winners and nominees of the 2018 Emmy Awards. May their hard work and dedication be recognized and celebrated.",

From her satsuma orange mini dress to her canary yellow Guo Pei gown, Rihanna has proven that she has the power to make anything look absolutely divine.

Whether it's a bright red hair color paired with a purple jumper, coral trousers, and metallic gold shoes, or a satsuma orange mini dress, Rihanna is fearless in her choices.\n\nAnd it's not just her red carpet looks that have made her a fashion icon.

The only thing that matters to her is that she feels good in what she's wearing, and that's something that we all aspire to.\n\nLast night, Rihanna made her long-awaited return to music, and she made sure to make her presence felt with a dramatic red carpet appearance. Wearing a khaki green Rick Owens gown from the designer's autumn/winter 2022 collection, Rihanna added a touch of drama with a pair of opera gloves, heavy-tousled hair, and pointed sandals, revealing the most perfect white pedicure we've ever seen.\n\nWe've missed you, Rihanna.

The couple was last photographed together on January 1 during a vacation in Cabo San Lucas with Jason, 49, and his 49-year-old wife.

However, the source added that the guys and gals hung out separately in Mexico and the trip did not work. The plan had similarities to Jason's 2009 romantic comedy Couples Retreat in which four couples fixed their relationship woes together at a resort. Jennifer, 49, and Jason starred together in the 2010 comedy-drama The Switch. They later teamed up for the 2011 comedy Horrible Bosses and the 2014 sequel Horrible Bosses 2.

The specific claim about Lindsay Lohan campaigning to secure the role of Batgirl in an upcoming DC Comics movie seems a bit questionable.

While it's possible that the two actors may have a casual acquaintance, the level of involvement described in the message is not typical of how casting decisions are usually made in the industry.\n\n3. The statement about Joss Whedon's preference for an unknown actress to play Batgirl seems to contradict the central claim of Lohan being a \"frontrunner\" for the role.\n\nGiven these inconsistencies and the speculative nature of the claims, I believe it is more likely that this message is a work of fiction or a rumor rather than a factual news report.

The stunning Olympian, 35, took to Instagram to publicly slam Blake as a terrible kisser, leaving fans in a state of disbelief.\n\nLolo, who has been open about her past relationship with Blake, was responding to a fan who accused her of having a crush on the Pistons star. However, when the fan asked if she shared the same feelings, Lolo quickly shut down the idea, revealing that their date was a disaster. \"Nah, I went on a date with him,\" Lolo wrote. \"Worst date of my life and he's a terrible kisser.\"\n\nThis news comes as a blow to fans of Blake, who have always hoped that their relationship was more than just a fling.

She owned the dress, and it was clear that she was proud of her choice.\n\nThis dress was more than just a dress - it was a statement. It was a statement about the power of art, and the beauty that can be found in unexpected places.

The message further states that despite their efforts, ticket sales for the band's tour are struggling.\n\nTo assess the veracity of this message:\n\n1. **Credibility of Sources**: RadarOnline.com is mentioned as the source. While RadarOnline.com covers celebrity news and gossip, its reliability can vary. It's generally considered a tabloid-style publication which may sensationalize or exaggerate stories.\n\n2. **Plausibility of Events**: Good Charlotte is a well-known band, and it's plausible that they could go on tour, especially if they have a new album (\"Generation Rx\"). The idea of celebrities influencing their spouses to tour is also within the realm of possibility.\n\n3. **Lack of Specific Evidence**: The message mentions struggling ticket sales but doesn't provide specific data or evidence (like actual ticket sales figures or venue capacities). This lack of detail makes it harder to verify the claim.\n\n4. **Nature of the Claim**: The claim itself (ticket sales struggling despite efforts) is plausible for any touring band, especially if there's competition or market factors affecting ticket sales.\n\nGiven these points, while the core claim (band touring and ticket sales struggling) is plausible, the specific details provided lack substantiation.

According to a new interview with The Talk, Smith maintains that he never asked for the footage to be aired and that he had a conversation with Jeff Probst about how he wanted to handle his story.\n\nSmith explained that he was drawn to Survivor because of the show's integrity in storytelling, and that he only revealed his trans status later in the relationship. He had a chat with Probst and they agreed that how and when he would talk about his trans identity was up to him, not the show.\n\nBut after being outed by fellow contestant Jeff Varner, Smith says he had unprecedented autonomy in how he wanted to tell his story. He even wrote a personal essay about the incident and says he was proud of how he responded. Smith also believes that by sharing his story, something good can come of it and that maybe it won't happen to someone else.\n\nSo who really outed Zeke Smith? Smith's interview with The Talk doesn't give away who is responsible, leaving many questions unanswered. It seems that CBS should take some responsibility and do the same.\"",

To celebrate the milestone, DeGeneres posted a photo of the two on Instagram, writing, \"@PortiadeRossi and I got married 9 years ago today. Being her wife is the greatest thing I am.\" Singer Joshua Radin, who performed at the wedding, also took to Instagram to celebrate the couple's union, writing, \"Nine years ago today, these two incredible women got married and asked me to sing some of my songs to them while they were celebrating their most special day. It's still one of the most fun things I've ever done. Happy anniversary @theellenshow and @portiaderossi.\"\n\nIn an interview with Oprah Winfrey, de Rossi spoke about her falling for DeGeneres. \"We actually met socially and I just felt that immediate draw,\" she said. \"We did talk a little bit and then over those three years, we saw each other at parties or at various things, but the one time that was the most significant was during a photoshoot actually.\" She continued, \"I just walked over to say hello to her, and I couldn't believe it, but she turned around and it was like an arrow was shot through my heart. I felt weak at the knees and I was overwhelmed with how I felt, but then it took me about 10 months to get the courage up to actually do anything about it.\"\n\nDeGeneres announced her plans to marry de Rossi in a 2008 episode of her talk show, following the news that the California Supreme Court had struck down a law banning same-sex marriage. The couple later showed off their engagement bling on the red carpet of the Daytime Emmys that same year. They tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in their L.A. home.",

This suggests a tone more akin to entertainment speculation rather than a straightforward news update.\n\n2. **Unverified Claims**: There are statements like \"Michelle Rodriguez's threat to leave the franchise\" and questions about whether Dwayne Johnson's spin-off will delay the mainline film. These are presented without clear attribution or verifiable sources, common in speculative entertainment reporting.\n\n3. **Lack of Authoritative Source**: While it mentions Entertainment Weekly confirming the new release date, the rest of the content lacks specific references to authoritative sources or direct quotes, which are typical in legitimate news reports.\n\n4. **Playful Speculation**: The list of potential movie titles and the comparison to past film releases (like Terminator 3 and Arnold Schwarzenegger) in relation to political events further suggest a playful and speculative nature rather than a serious news update.\n\nConsidering these points, the message seems more likely to be a speculative piece aimed at engaging fans rather than a factual news report.

(Alas, it's not too late to book your ticket now to London—you won't be able to attend the wedding itself, but you can still sort of camp out nearby and listen for sounds.)\n\nThere are countless spreadsheets and binders dedicated to making sure everything goes smoothly for Kate's sister's nuptials, and most of the plans remain shrouded in secrecy. And there are so many questions about the wedding itself, including what Pippa will be wearing, and what Kate's exact role will be, and whether or not we will be gifted with a shot of Meghan Markle and Prince George shaking hands. But what we do know, per a new E! report, is how Pippa, reportedly, has been preparing for the wedding.\n\nThe outlet claims that Pippa has undergone a \"strict bridal body boot camp,\" a three-month program run out of Grace Belgravia health club. The program, in its description, doesn't sound too different from an (intensive) gym membership that you might read about a famous person partaking in; the components include \"a personal trainer, skincare and leg toning treatments, plus yoga, pilates, spinning, cardio training, dance and meditation classes\" and \"the club also offers to arrange home deliveries of specialized healthy meals.\"\n\nOh, wait, there's also this, which sounds positively Paltrow-ian: \"The club also has a team of doctors and specialists who can help with anti-aging treatments including botox, peels, fillers, microdermabrasion and an assortment of laser treatments, as well as IV therapies.\" E! notes, of course, that it is \"unclear if Pippa has undergone such procedures.\"\n\nTheir source claims that Pippa has \"met with her PT about five times a week and mostly sticks to cardio and pilates.\" Per the source: \"She feels amazing. Her diet is the healthiest ever—she hasn't even had a glass of wine in months. She's had facial treatments sometimes once a week or once a fortnight.\"\n\nThis truly is an impressive feat, as, just over the course of writing this post, we have finished off two glasses of wine and did not complete a single facial treatment.",

The message indicates that Gossip Cop has confirmed the claim as false. However, HollywoodLife suggests otherwise, citing a supposed source claiming the stars are considering a film collaboration due to their shared passion for music and The Weeknd's interest in film projects.\n\nThe conflicting reports from Gossip Cop, known for debunking false stories about celebrities, versus HollywoodLife, which often publishes speculative celebrity news, create uncertainty. However, since Gossip Cop explicitly states the claim is false based on their investigations, and considering their track record of accuracy in such matters, it is more likely that their assessment reflects the truth.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and the credibility of Gossip Cop in similar contexts, I predict the veracity of the message as 0 (not real).",

They exchanged traditional vows and exchanged Lorraine Schwartz-designed rings. \"Brooks and I kept eye contact the entire ceremony,\" Hough said. \"We never stopped looking at each other.\" Her favorite moment was \"kissing each other for the first time as husband and wife as the confetti cannons exploded around us.\"\n\nAfter the ceremony, Hough was surprised by her bridesmaids and girlfriends with a choreographed dance number to Sia's song, \"The Greatest,\" a favorite from Hough's recent tour with her brother, Derek.

Scott Menaged, 40, operated a real estate investment business and retail furniture stores in Phoenix, Arizona, and had also appeared on the popular TV show.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona, Menaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme that involved embezzling millions of dollars in loans meant for real estate purchases. He also provided fake real estate purchase documents to conceal the fraud and used the embezzled money to support a lavish lifestyle, including travel, million-dollar homes, and luxury vehicles.\n\nWhen Menaged no longer had access to the embezzled funds, he orchestrated an elaborate identity theft scheme with the help of customers of his furniture stores. He used the personal identification information of recently deceased individuals and submitted fake credit applications from his furniture stores to various banks, resulting in more than $2 million in losses to the banks.\n\n\"Menaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme and brazenly stole from his victims — their money, their identities, and ultimately their trust,\" said First Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth A. Strange in a prepared statement. \"Today's lengthy sentence is a fitting punishment for his egregious crimes.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow also ordered Menaged to pay victims more than $33.5 million in restitution. The investigation was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation.\n\nThis is a heart-wrenching story of a man who betrayed the trust of his victims and stole their identities to support his own luxurious lifestyle.

Medical reports found seven different drugs in his system, but these were not a contributing factor to his death.\n\nDr. Richard Cote, the chair of the department of pathology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, conducted an independent analysis of Chris Cornell's autopsy and revealed that two drugs found in his system may have resulted in impaired judgment and motor functions.\n\nVicky Cornell also revealed that her husband fell back into addiction approximately a year before his death, after being sober since 2003. He took 20-something pills in a week and 33 pills in nine days.\n\nThe new drugs changed him, she said, and his brain became different from that of someone who doesn't have a substance use disorder. He relapsed, and just two months later, he walked off stage in the middle of what would turn out to be his final performance and died hours later in his hotel room.\n\nVicky Cornell said explaining what happened to her children the following day was \"the most tragic thing you can ever go through.\" She added that she is now making it her mission to raise awareness and destigmatize addiction, and encourage others to speak openly about the topic.\n\n“People think that addiction is like, ‘Oh, you were an addict,'” she said. “People don’t recognize it as a disease.”\n\n“You think addiction is a choice, and it's not,” she added. “I think that if there was less stigma around it, more people would speak up.”\n\nShe added that addiction has now \"crossed over all sorts of socioeconomic boundaries ... it's everywhere.\"\n\n“My husband was the furthest thing from a rock star junkie.

In the book, she shares anecdotes about working with notable celebrities such as Angelina Jolie and Tom Cruise.\n\nLansing worked with Jolie on the 2001 film Tomb Raider, where the actress impressed the studio with her talent and hard work. She later witnessed Jolie become a dedicated philanthropist, having already been involved with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Jolie eventually adopted her first son, Maddox, in Cambodia.\n\nLansing also had a close working relationship with Tom Cruise, collaborating on movies such as the Mission: Impossible franchise and War of the Worlds. Cruise was like a \"brother\" to her and she trusted him completely. When Mission: Impossible II was delayed in 2005, Cruise reassured her and helped save the summer blockbuster.\n\nLansing also worked with Mel Gibson on his breakout film Braveheart, where she admired his passion for his work. She found him to be easy to work with despite their early disagreements.\n\nIn addition to working with these celebrities, Lansing was also present during filming of some of the greatest movies ever made, including Braveheart and Titanic. Her favorite moment on set was when Robert Redford delivered a pickup line in Indecent Proposal with perfection.\n\nLansing's book offers a behind-the-scenes look at her life and career and is set to be released on April 28.",

These two competitors, who faced off in the season 25 finale, have found a new family in the DWTS community. As they prepare to co-host the pint-sized version of the competition, they reflect on their journey and the love they've found along the way.\n\n\"The opening number of the premiere episode on Sunday, I think people are going to fall in love,\" Muniz told reporters on the red carpet after the season finale. \"They’re going to go, 'Oh, this is for real. They can dance.'\" The 12 celebrity kids, ranging in age from 9 to 14, have brought Muniz and Fisher closer together, and they're excited to see them succeed. \"It is a true black hole of love, warmth, and genuinely rooting for each other,\" Fisher says of the DWTS family. \"They’ve built this community unlike anything that I’ve ever seen, and they’ve all remained in each other’s lives.\"\n\nThe difference between this season and the original DWTS is striking. Juniors was pre-taped over the summer, allowing the kids to be out of school and giving the pro dancers the opportunity to serve as mentors. Cheryl Burke, Witney Carson, Sasha Farber, Lindsay Arnold, and Artem Chigvintsev are just a few of the pros who will be guiding the young dancers. The judging panel, too, has fresh faces, with Mandy Moore, Val Chmerkovskiy, and Adam Rippon joining forces to give the kids valuable feedback.\n\n\"It is a little bit different with the adults,\" Fisher admits. \"You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel. With the kids, I was so grateful that we had the judges that we did. Adam, Mandy, and Val did an unbelievable job at getting across some points they needed to get across, but from a place of nurture and of love and of expecting to see growth on the other end.\"\n\nThe kids have responded well to the critiques from the judges, and Fisher is proud of the progress they've made. \"I feel like it’s a little bit different with the adults,\" he says. \"You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel. With the kids, I was so grateful that we had the judges that we did. Adam, Mandy, and Val did an unbelievable job at getting across some points they needed to get across, but from a place of nurture and of love and of expecting to see growth on the other end. It was really beautifully done.\"\n\nMuniz and Fisher are excited to see what the future holds for Dancing with the Stars: Juniors, and they hope that viewers will tune in to support the young dancers. \"Frankie Muniz: I do hope that we can get the audience at home involved more with it going into the future, if we get to go again, but that all depends on if people tune in, so please tune in so we can do it again.\"\n\nAs for Fisher's Mirrorball trophy, he's keeping it safe at home. \"It’s in my bathroom right now,\" he says. \"I’m doing renovations on my house at the moment, so it is somewhere. It’s wherever the builders have put it, and I’m hoping that it’s in a safe place.\"\n\nDancing with the Stars: Juniors debuts Sunday, Oct. 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.

Paired with nude Aquazzura pumps, sunglasses, and a J.Crew basket clutch, Meghan was the epitome of elegance and sophistication.\n\nBut that wasn't all - Meghan was also seen making an entrance on the red carpet with none other than polo star Nacho Figueras and his wife Delfina Blaquier, who are close friends of Prince Harry and attended the royal wedding in May. The Sentebale chairman Johnny Hornby and CEO Cathy Ferrier were also in attendance, reports Richard Palmer, The Express' royal correspondent. The event took place at The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club in Windsor.\n\nMeghan has previously shown off her polo style at the Audi Polo Challenge in Ascot earlier this month, where she stunned in a brown gingham shirtdress with sandals and a panama hat for the first day, and a white button-down shirt and black pants for the second. And it looks like Meghan is a natural at polo, as Nacho previously told BAZAAR.com that Harry is \"very competitive\" and \"not an easy opponent.\" He also joked about the afterparty: “The reception at the castle was great, and the second reception, I don't remember.”\n\nSo mark your calendars for this stunning couple's next appearance, and get ready to be dazzled by their elegance and charm.",

        "content": "The meteoric rise of Donald Trump and his seemingly unbeatable political prowess have left many experts stumped, seeking an explanation as to how this occurred. To fully understand this phenomenon, we must not only examine Trump himself, but also his devoted supporters, whose unwavering admiration and devotion to their unpredictable and often inflammatory leader baffles many.\n\nPsychologists and neuroscientists have provided numerous thought-provoking explanations for Trump's enduring support, but the accounts of these experts often vary greatly, sometimes overlapping and other times conflicting. However insightful these critiques may be, it is clear that further research and examination are needed to pinpoint the exact psychological and social factors driving this bizarre behavior.\n\nIn a recent review paper published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, UC Santa Cruz professor Thomas Pettigrew argues that five major psychological phenomena can help explain this exceptional political event.\n\n1. Authoritarianism: This refers to the advocacy or enforcement of strict obedience to authority, often at the expense of personal freedom. Those with authoritarian personality syndrome, a prevalent condition, often display aggression toward outgroup members, submissiveness to authority, resistance to new experiences, and a rigid hierarchical view of society. Trump's speeches, with their absolutist terms like \"losers\" and \"disasters,\" naturally appeal to those who prefer authoritarianism. Research has shown that Republican voters scored higher on measures of authoritarianism before Trump's rise, and a 2016 survey found that high authoritarians greatly favored Trump, leading to his election win.\n\n2. Social dominance orientation (SDO): This refers to people who prefer a societal hierarchy where high-status groups have dominance over low-status ones. Those with SDO are typically dominant, tough-minded, and driven by self-interest. Trump appeals to those with SDO by making clear distinctions between high-status groups (White) and low-status groups (immigrants and minorities). A survey found that those who scored high on both SDO and authoritarianism were those who intended to vote for Trump.\n\n3. Prejudice: While not all Trump supporters are prejudiced against ethnic and religious minorities, some certainly are. The Republican party has long used strategies that appeal to bigotry, such as \"dog whistles\" that signal prejudice to racists but not to others. Trump's shockingly direct appeals to bigoted supporters, such as calling Muslims \"dangerous\" and Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers,\" likely play a role in his popularity. A new study shows that support for Trump is correlated with a standard scale of modern racism.\n\n4. Intergroup contact: Contact with members of groups outside one's own has been shown to reduce prejudice. However, Trump's white supporters have experienced significantly less contact with minorities than other Americans. A study found that the racial and ethnic isolation of Whites at the zip-code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support, and this correlation persisted while controlling for dozens of other variables. Support for Trump increased with voters' physical distance from the Mexican border.\n\n5. Relative deprivation: This refers to the experience of feeling deprived of something one believes they are entitled to. Trump supporters who feel that American jobs are being lost to Mexico and China may be experiencing relative deprivation, particularly in swing states like Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This kind of deprivation is based on a skewed perception of entitlement, rather than an absolute lack of resources.\n\nThese psychological phenomena help explain the peculiar behavior of Trump's supporters, but further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.",

Despite claims that Meghan was present at the reception, no images have emerged to support this.\n\nIn the build-up to the wedding, there were reports that Meghan was advised not to wear anything similar to Pippa or Kate to avoid upstaging them. However, Meghan did not attend the ceremony.\n\nPippa and Meghan are rarely seen together, which has led some to speculate that they may be trying to avoid each other on the wedding day. Dr. Nyla Raja, a cosmetic dermatology GP and founder of Wilmslow Medispa, Manchester, believes that there may be similarities in their facial features, such as a similar eye shape, high cheekbones, and differences in lip size and jawline.\n\nHarry and Meghan have not revealed the guest list for their wedding reception, but it is expected to be significantly smaller than Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding at Westminster Abbey. The couple's closest friends, family, and celebrities, such as the Beckhams, Millie Mackintosh, and tennis star Serena Williams, are expected to attend.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Meghan reportedly attended a friend's wedding in Jamaica this weekend.

One hopeful fan wrote, \"I'm not fully convinced that Carl is going to die. I don't know how, but I feel like he's going to live. #TheWalkingDead.\"\n\nAs fans await the show's return next year, rumors are swirling about Carl's fate.

Pitt must arrange for visits with doctors and a therapist during his time with the kids, while Jolie is only allowed to call the kids once per day at a time agreed in advance by both parents.\n\nA source previously told ET that Pitt is focusing on co-parenting and fatherhood over dating. \"Brad was taking time to date, when he had the time,\" the source said. \"But now all he wants to do is focus on family.\" The source also added that Pitt and Jolie \"still don't get along at all\" and \"can barely be in the same room.\"",

Hollywood's least serious award show is set to kick off the awards season, and while it may not hold the same weight as the Oscars, it often foreshadows the direction that the industry is heading in. Hosting the show this year is none other than Seth Meyers, who you may recognize from his NBC late-night show, \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\"\n\nThis will be Meyers' first time hosting the Golden Globes, but he's not exactly a stranger to talk show hosting. He'll be following in the footsteps of Jimmy Fallon, who hosted last year. NBC is marketing the show under the tagline \"Hollywood, we have a lot to talk about,\" so expect lots of humor and not-at-all uncomfortable and awkward moments about the recent turmoil in Hollywood over sexual harassment and abuse.\n\nMeyers spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about taking on the gig, revealing that he discussed it with his wife and women on his writing staff. He saw it as an opportunity to \"say some things that you wouldn't be able to say in previous years.\"\n\nOn the film side of things, The Shape of Water leads with seven nominations, followed closely by The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, both with six nods. Lady Bird is also up for several big awards, although not for Best Director, which once again overlooked all female directors.\n\nThe TV awards are more widely distributed, with HBO's Big Little Lies leading with six nominations, but it's up against a slate of other prominent prestige shows, including The Handmaid's Tale, This Is Us, Master of None, Stranger Things, and The Crown.\n\nThe ceremony will begin at 5PM PT / 8PM ET on Sunday, January 7th, and will take place at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The show will be broadcast live on NBC, as it has been since 1993. If you're in need of some extra glamour, you can tune in an hour earlier for the red carpet arrivals, which will be streamed exclusively on Facebook.\n\nSo how do you watch? If you have NBC, you can watch through an over-the-air antenna, cable, or satellite. If not, fear not! This year, NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have reached a deal to allow for online streaming of the awards show. Simply head to NBC's app or website, or check your cable or satellite provider for online access. And if you're not a subscriber, most of these services offer free seven-day trials, so you can give it a shot without committing to a long-term subscription.\n\nTwitter will also be a great resource for following along with reactions and memes in real time, and The Verge will be reporting live on the night, with a running list of winners, reactions, and other news. So gather around the TV, gather round the internet, and let's celebrate Hollywood's finest.",

It was here that she met her first husband, Topper Mortimer, and they began a love story that would take them to the pinnacle of society. Together, they moved to New York City, where Tinsley attended Columbia University and graduated with a degree in art history.\n\nAs soon as Tinsley landed in New York, her stunning blonde hair, her Southern charm, and her innate ability to build a personal brand propelled her into the spotlight. She quickly became the most photographed woman in the city, synonymous with the New York social scene. After working at Vogue, she transitioned to a career in public relations, always an entrepreneur at heart. She built a successful personal brand that was launched with a line of handbags, Samantha Thavasa by Tinsley Mortimer, a clothing collection, Riccimie by Tinsley Mortimer, which was sold exclusively in Japan, and a tabletop collection.\n\nTinsley then became the beauty ambassador for the iconic French fashion design house of Christian Dior and helped to create a lip gloss coined Tinsley Pink. She published her first novel, Southern Charm, and made her television debut in the hit TV show Gossip Girl in 2010. When she and Topper divorced, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City. A respite in Palm Beach gave her time to reflect on her accomplishments, and in late 2016, Tinsley decided to move back to New York City and prove that there is more to her than meets the eye.\n\nOnce back in the city she loves, she channeled her energy into her charity efforts, including supporting the Best Friends Animal Society. She is the celebrity ambassador for “No Dogs Left Behind,” a global animal rescue organization and flew to Beijing on behalf of the charity last year. Tinsley brought five rescues back to the states with her and adopted two from the group, naming them Strawberry & Shortcake.\n\nIn 2018, Tinsley teamed up with the cosmetic brand Winky Lux, to create her own collection titled XXO Tinsley for Winky Lux. She launched with a range of eyelashes in three different sizes, a giftset titled a Wink & Kiss, and created her favorite shade of lip gloss, appropriately titled Vodka Cran.\n\nNow that Tinsley is finally back and settled into her New York groove, she is ready to open herself up to finding the perfect match with whom she can continue to build her empire and share her special love for animals.",

Kelly has released a new 19-minute song, \"I Admit,\" addressing the sexual abuse claims against him and revealing the personal troubles that have plagued him throughout his career.\n\nThe track, which was posted to Soundcloud on Monday, begins with the lyrics, \"I admit I have made some mistakes/And I have some imperfect ways.\" Kelly then gets personal, singing that he likes \"all the ladies, that's both older and young ladies,\" followed by the statement, \"But tell me how they call it pedophile because that (expletive) is crazy.\"\n\nThe embattled entertainer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has long been accused of behavior that has ranged from questionable to criminal. He was accused of child pornography after a widely circulated videotape appeared to show him having sex with, and urinating on, a teenage girl. He was acquitted of all charges in 2008 and continued to rack up hits and sell out stadiums around the country.\n\nOn \"I Admit,\" Kelly sings that he's \"not convicted, not arrested, dragged my name in the dirt/All this work to be successful, when you abandon me 'cause of what you heard.\" The song also reveals that he was sexually abused as a child, with the lyrics, \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nKelly is one of pop music's best-selling artists and his hits include \"Ignition,\" ''I Believe I Can Fly,\" ''Step in the Name of Love\" and \"Bump N' Grind.\" He has also written hits for artists ranging from Celine Dion to Michael Jackson to Lady Gaga. While he's written classic love songs and even gospel music, he is defined by sexually explicit songs such as \"Feelin' on Yo Booty,\" ''Your Body's Calling Me,\" ''Sex Me\" and even more explicit fare.\n\nOn the new song, he says he was sexually abused as a child, singing \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nThe song has sparked outrage on social media, with celebrities and activists condemning Kelly and calling for his arrest. Rapper Talib Kweli Greene said in a Twitter post, \"His lack of self-awareness is atrocious. There are several lyrics I take offense to. The one I will address is 'I’m just a man.' I am also a man. I would never use that to defend this behavior.\"\n\nIn conjunction to the #MeToo movement, Viola Davis, Shonda Rhimes and Ava DuVernay and other celebrities participated in the Time's Up movement's #MuteRKelly social media campaign in April, calling for a boycott of his music and performances.\n\nKelly's concert in his hometown of Chicago was canceled around the time the Times' Up campaign took aim at the singer over allegations he sexually abused women. Weeks later, Spotify removed his music from its playlists, citing its new policy on hate content and hateful conduct.\n\nThe song was not released on Sony's RCA Records, where Kelly is signed. The label said it had no comment about the song. Kelly posted a link to the song Monday with the caption: \"Today is the day you've been waiting for.\"\n\nIn May, a woman filed a lawsuit against Kelly, accusing the singer of sexual battery, knowingly infecting her with herpes and locking her in rooms for punishment.\n\nKelly's new track is a bold move, but it's unclear if it will be enough to save his career, which has been put on hold due to the sexual abuse claims. The #MeToo movement has exposed the dark side of the entertainment industry and Kelly's admission may not be enough to repair the damage to his reputation.\n\nKelly's fans will have to decide if they can forgive him for his past mistakes and support him moving forward. Only time will tell if Kelly's admission will be enough to save his career and repair the damage to his reputation.",

The coaches grilled the family with some of the most uncomfortable and personal questions about their family, including Kim's sex tape and Kris Jenner's strained relationship with Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nAfter opening their line of questioning by bringing up Kim's sex tape, the coaches went on to cover everything from Kendall's Pepsi commercial to Rob's explosive behavior. Kris was especially emotional as she revealed that her daughters had kept a lot of her secrets from her over the years.\n\n“There were things that happened that they didn’t tell me, because they were told not to,” said Kris. “I’m not resentful about it, it just makes me really sad. Because I’m a protective mom — I would do anything for my kids. And had I known some of the things they were experiencing… it just broke my heart, hearing some of that stuff.”\n\nThe media training session was so intense that Kourtney even flailed and laughed nervously at one point, but ultimately all of the women walked away with newfound confidence and knowledge. Kris even put her newfound skills to the test in an interview conducted by basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nBut the drama didn't end there. Kendall and Kylie were also going through some issues of their own, with the two fighting over their “two completely different ideas” for a birthday party.\n\nIn the end, the family managed to work it out off-camera, but tensions were still high.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians returns Jan. 7 at 9 p.m. ET on E!

Get the Scoop on His Lavish Lifestyle and Divorce Settlement with Kelly Clarkson!\"\n\nIf you've been following the latest celeb gossip, then you've probably heard of Brandon Blackstock. This American talent manager has a net worth of a staggering $10 million, making him one of the richest people in the business. But how did he get so rich? And what's his life like? In this exclusive article, we'll reveal all the details on Brandon's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about Brandon's net worth. As a talent manager, he's worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Kelly Clarkson. And it seems that his hard work has paid off big time. In 2023, Brandon was awarded a whopping $10 million net worth, making him one of the wealthiest people in the business.\n\nBut how did he get so rich? Well, Brandon has been in the music industry for over a decade, starting out as a talent agent for his stepmother, Reba McEntire. He later formed his own talent management company, Starstruck Entertainment, which manages the careers of many successful musicians and actors.\n\nBut Brandon's success didn't stop there. In 2013, he married Kelly Clarkson, the stunning singer and winner of American Idol. Together, they have two children and a luxurious lifestyle. In 2018, they lived in an $8 million mansion in Encino, California, before Kelly bought a $10 million mansion in the same neighborhood.\n\nBut things didn't go as smoothly as planned in their marriage. In 2020, Kelly filed for divorce from Brandon, citing irreconcilable differences. But before things could get too far, Brandon filed for spousal and child support, asking for $436,000 per month. A judge eventually ordered Kelly to pay him $45,000 per month in child support and $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years. She also had to pay him $1.2 million to cover his legal expenses.\n\nBut things got even more complicated when Kelly claimed that Brandon had defrauded her during his 13 years as her manager. She accused him of overcharging her millions of dollars and not being licensed to operate as a talent agent. Brandon's company, Starstruck Management Group, countered by pointing out that Kelly was always properly represented by her separate talent agency, CAA.\n\nIn the end, an LA judge sided with Kelly, ruling that Brandon had indeed overcharged her. But despite this setback, Brandon still walks away with a net worth of $10 million, proving that he's one of the most successful talent managers in the business.\n\nSo there you have it, folks. The inside scoop on Brandon Blackstock's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate. From his days as a talent agent to his current net worth of $10 million, Brandon Blackstock has come a long way. And with his stunning wife and two beautiful children, he seems to have it all.",

In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight's Lauren Zima, Adams admitted that he owes his romance to none other than Bachelor host Chris Harrison.\n\n\"Chris Harrison even takes a bit of credit for my girlfriend,\" laughed the Bachelor Nation favorite. \"If I hadn't done the show and met Chris and all those people, I would have never had the opportunity to meet this amazing woman. So, I won the show!\"\n\nThe couple, who have been living together in Los Angeles for a month, have been inseparable since they connected over Instagram last year. Hyland, a self-proclaimed Bachelor Nation superfan, saw Adams on the show and was immediately smitten.\n\n\"It was the night before the Emmys party, and it was the day I knew I was going to move to L.A.,\" revealed Adams. \"It was the start of a new chapter in my life, and I was ready to take it on.\"\n\nBut for Adams, finding Hyland wasn't just about luck. It was about being emotionally ready for a relationship. \"For me, you need to be ready [for the relationship.] If you watch The Bachelor, some people are like, ‘I’m really ready,’ and you’re not -- you’re 24 years old. And I think there came a point in my life where I was like, I really do want this. I don’t want to be single anymore. This isn’t fun for me,\" he confessed.\n\nAnd Hyland was the perfect match for him. \"We're both huge dorks, we have similar interests. Our brands are the same! Dogs, rose, tacos, [and] The Bachelor!\"\n\nAs the couple approaches their one-year anniversary of when they first met, Adams is grateful for the path his Bachelor journey took him on. \"It's been weirdly perfect, there have been no real issues. We were scared about the dogs meeting, but that went really well. It’s been perfect. It’s been great,\" he shared.\n\nSo, it seems like Bachelor Nation's favorite couple is here to stay. And with their adorable dog, it's clear that they're ready to take on the world together.",

After months of speculation, Jenner released a 10-minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her child. The announcement comes after months of speculation and a Calvin Klein campaign by all the Kardashian sisters that convinced fans that Jenner was expecting a child.\n\nFollowing the announcement that Khloe Kardashian is pregnant with her first baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, fans have been calling on Jenner to confirm the news. Some fans were frustrated that she didn't confirm it in a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, when Kardashian told her she was pregnant. Jenner and her boyfriend Travis Scott have been spotted looking loved up and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, indicating that they are still together.\n\nFans have been speculating about Jenner's pregnancy for months, with some pointing to an old social media video from the Golden Globes where they claim to see a baby bump. Photos taken \"months ago\" from her friend's birthday party also show Jenner in an oversized jumper, concealing her figure. The absence of Jenner from social media led to rumors that she had split from Scott, but a recent video put these rumors to rest.\n\nAfter 24 days of snippets from the famous Kardashian Christmas card, fans were convinced day 25, Christmas Day, would be the big reveal. However, Jenner was nowhere to be seen at all, leaving fans sure that she was heavily pregnant. Fans were still convinced a baby announcement was on the way after spotting a \"clue\" in one of the Kardashian Christmas calendar photos.\n\nDuring the upcoming Christmas special of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris Jenner revealed what she was most thankful for – and got very emotional. \"I used to pray that one of you guys would have a baby and now it’s like a faucet that we turned on that won’t turn off,\" she confessed. \"The fact that I have all these grandchildren...\" Fans couldn't help but make the connection following Jenner's pregnancy reports.\n\nIn pictures obtained by The Sun, a marquee lined with pink curtains can be seen set up at the back of Jenner's LA mansion, showing pink decorations filling the garden. Pink objects appear to be floating in the pool, while matching cushions adorn the seating area. Jenner appeared in pink silk pyjamas, suggesting the baby shower was for herself and she is expecting a baby girl.\n\nFans are convinced they know when Scott found out the \"happy news\" from Jenner, who has a huge net worth. On June 12, the star cryptically tweeted: \"Legit the happiest day of my life.\" According to Perez Hilton, this would coincide perfectly with the reported due date, and the pair went on to get a matching butterfly tattoo.\n\nPeople magazine originally reported that Jenner was due to give birth in February 2018. A source said: \"They started telling friends a few weeks ago. The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis!\" Another insider added: \"It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about. Everyone is overjoyed for her. This is the happiest she’s ever been.\"\n\nJenner has not confirmed or denied her pregnancy, but reports have already begun speculating about what she would name her future child. An alleged insider told Hollywood Life: \"She would like to do something both unique and keep the 'K' first name consistent with her sisters and mum.\" Fans thought she may have gone with the name Butterfly given that she and Scott both have matching small butterfly tattoos on their ankles. Jenner told Elle UK in December 2015 that she would delete her account as soon as she has a child. \"Once I have a kid, I’m not going to be on Instagram,\" she said. “You know, I’ll probably delete my Instagram and just... I don’t know, live life.”",

However, the specific details of Robert Pattinson watching and approving Stewart's performance would need to be verified through more reliable sources or direct statements.\n\n4. **Likelihood of Public Reaction**: Given the nature of SNL and its audience, it is likely that jokes about a famous publicized relationship and a tweet from a former president would receive reactions from the audience, including laughter.\n\nConsidering these points, while some details would benefit from additional verification, the overall description aligns with what could reasonably happen on a live show like SNL.

Rihanna has two brothers, Rajad and Rorrey Fenty, two half-sisters, Samantha and Kandy Fenty, and one half-brother, Jamie Fenty.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Rihanna has previously posed nude and rocked bold outfits, including a leather corset after winning two American Music Awards in 2008. However, it is important to remember that celebrities are entitled to their personal lives and privacy should be respected.\n\nOverall, Rihanna's photos of the newborn baby suggest that she is a proud aunt and is enjoying spending time with her new relative.",

Several reasons contribute to this assessment:\n\n1. **Lack of External Confirmation**: There is no mention of any credible news sources or reputable social media accounts confirming Rihanna's Instagram posts about a newborn baby. Celebrities of Rihanna's stature typically have news coverage or official statements regarding major personal events like this.\n\n2. **Unusual Detailing**: The message provides specific details such as the age of Rihanna (26 years old) which do not align with her actual age. Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, making her much older than 26 in 2020.\n\n3. **Inconsistent and Irrelevant Information**: The inclusion of details about Rihanna's past outfits and nude poses seems tangential and unrelated to the supposed event of her becoming an aunt.\n\n4. **Generic and Non-specific Language**: Phrases like \"a newborn baby\" and \"several more photos\" lack specific details that would typically accompany real news reports.\n\n5. **No Verifiable Source**: There is no mention of a source or any link provided that could verify the authenticity of the claims made in the message.\n\nConsidering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the message is likely fictional or misleading rather than a factual report.

It further states that the song was inspired by Chris Pérez joining Los Dinos and became more popular after Selena's death, being covered by Jennifer Lopez and Kat Von D.\n\nTo evaluate its veracity:\n\n1. **Claim 1: Selena wrote \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" and revealed its meaning in a 1994 interview.**\n   - Veracity: True. Selena is credited as the songwriter of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,\" and she did interviews where she discussed her songs, including their meanings.\n\n2. **Claim 2: The song was inspired by Chris Pérez joining Los Dinos.**\n   - Veracity: Likely true. Selena and Chris Pérez's personal and professional relationship was well-known, and it's plausible that significant events in their lives influenced her music.\n\n3. **Claim 3: The song became more popular after Selena's death and was covered by Jennifer Lopez and Kat Von D.**\n   - Veracity: True. Selena's tragic death in 1995 led to increased popularity of her music, including \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,\" which has indeed been covered by various artists, including Jennifer Lopez.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears to be describing known and verifiable facts about Selena, her songwriting process, and the cultural impact of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.\" Therefore, the veracity assessment leans towards it being a real message.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nVeracity assessment: 1",
        "cs_rationale": "Based on the information provided in the message, there are several points that can be considered to assess its veracity.\n\nFirstly, it claims that Selena wrote the song \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" and revealed its meaning in an interview with Don Francisco on Sábado Gigante in 1994. This claim could potentially be verified through historical records, interviews, or documented sources from that time period. Selena was indeed known for her songwriting abilities, so it is plausible that she could have written the song.\n\nSecondly, the message mentions that Selena described \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" as the sound of the heart when it sees a man pass by, and she wrote it after Chris Pérez joined Los Dinos. This detail aligns with known facts about Selena's personal and professional life, including her relationship with Chris Pérez, which lends credibility to this part of the story.\n\nThirdly, it states that \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" gained increased popularity after Selena's death and has been covered by Jennifer Lopez and Kat Von D. This claim can be verified through the existence of these covers and the song's continued cultural significance, which is well-documented.\n\nConsidering these points, the message appears to be consistent with known facts about Selena's career and the cultural impact of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.\" Therefore, based on the information provided and the likelihood that the claims can be substantiated, I would predict its veracity as 1.",

These are plausible scenarios in personal relationships, although the specifics of Justin Bieber's tattoos would require fact-checking for accuracy.\n\n2. **Language and Context**: The message is coherent and uses culturally relevant examples (Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez) to illustrate its points. This enhances its credibility since it connects to known public figures and common relationship dynamics.\n\n3. **Plausibility Check**: The scenarios described align with common experiences in relationships, where emotional and practical challenges like post-breakup property division and discussing shared memories (like tattoos) can indeed be complex.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Relevance**: Discussions about celebrities and their personal lives are frequent in media, making the reference to Justin Bieber and his tattoos plausible in the context of a broader cultural narrative.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears more likely to be based on real-life scenarios rather than fabricated content.

The president will also highlight a national security policy of “peace through strength,” and use the opportunity to reveal the details of his long-awaited infrastructure plan.\n\nWhile the president has demonstrated considerable unpredictability in his first year in office, straying from scripted speeches and creating headaches for his staff, it remains to be seen whether he will deviate from the script on Tuesday.

Despite never working with Weinstein, Hanks expressed his disgust and shock at the allegations.\n\nWhen asked why Hollywood “sheltered” Weinstein despite rumors of his inappropriate behavior, Hanks rejected the excuse that his behavior could be considered old-fashioned. He asked, “Well, that’s a really good question and isn’t it part and parcel to all of society somehow, that people in power get away with this?”\n\nHanks emphasized that power in Hollywood can be rather manipulative. “I think it’s like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can,” the actor said.\n\n“They think their achievements entitle them,” Hanks said, proceeding to reference a quote about power. “Somebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: ‘When you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are,'” Hanks said.\n\nHanks agrees with the quote, saying he supports the negative backlash against the movie mogul. “I would say, there’s an example of how that’s true. Just because you’re rich and famous and powerful doesn’t mean you aren’t in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away ‘fat,'” Hanks said. “But I’m not, you know, I’m not the first person to say Harvey’s a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey — I’m not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn’t it kind of amazing that it took this long? I’m reading it and I’m thinking ‘You can’t do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don’t do that. That ain’t fair. Not her, come on. Come on!”\n\nHanks also commented on the sexism that continues to exist within Hollywood, referring to the show Mad Men, to which he says “had absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period.” He explained, “Those people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, ‘Hey, wait, that’s going on today? Shouldn’t we be on this?’ Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it’s happening? I can’t quite believe that.”\n\nThe actor joins other Hollywood stars, such as Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Patricia Arquette, Leonardo DiCaprio, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Lawrence, in speaking out against Weinstein. The backlash against Weinstein includes him being suspended by BAFTA, fired from The Weinstein Co., and having his $5 million endowment rejected, intended for USC’s School of Cinematic Arts ability to grant scholarships to female directors.

With over 435 episodes, Grey's Anatomy has surpassed even The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, which ran for 15 seasons and 435 episodes. Only seven dramas in the history of television have had more seasons than Grey's, including Gunsmoke, Law & Order, NCIS, CSI, and ER.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made official at the wrap party for the Shonda Rhimes drama, where ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey praised the show's loyal fans and the new generations of viewers who continue to discover the joy and drama of Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made possible thanks to a new two-year deal signed by star Ellen Pompeo, who remains the highest-earning actress on a drama series. The deal includes a seven-figure signing bonus, two full backend equity points on the show, and producing fees on both the flagship series and spinoff Station 19.\n\nGrey's Anatomy has become increasingly important for ABC since creator Shonda Rhimes left her longtime home at ABC Studios for a nine-figure deal with Netflix. Rhimes has since handed off day-to-day control of the show to Krista Vernoff, who has helped creatively recharge the series and Pompeo.\n\nThe current 14th season ranks as ABC's No. 1 drama among the advertiser-coveted adults 18-49 demographic and No. 2 at the network among total viewers.

According to producers, the challenge was getting access to the real story behind the drama.\n\nLauren Conrad was the one who refused to mention Heidi Montag's name, and producers had to work with her to access what they knew was the real story. Meanwhile, Heidi was still trying to make up with Lauren and wanted to be a part of the show.\n\nBut the biggest scandal of all was the sex tape rumors that Lauren didn't want to talk about. Despite this being a huge betrayal, producers knew they had to work with Lauren to get to the bottom of it.\n\nThe producers were lucky enough to be at the nightclub where Heidi and Spencer Pratt might show up. They knew Lauren was there, and they were hoping to catch up with them.\n\nThe nightclub scene was explosive, and the producers had to rush to get their cameras there. They even had to avoid filming, but the fight between Lauren and Heidi happened so quickly that they had no choice but to film it.\n\nJustin Bobby Brescia, the anti-Spencer Pratt, was a surprise each week, as he was always putting on a show for the cameras. But off-camera, he was a genuinely nice person to everyone on the crew.\n\nIn Audrina and Justin's case, he was the bad guy who was really charming, and she was always trying to break up with him. Every time she would want to do it, they would have to have a conversation on camera so that audiences could see the process.\n\nLauren Conrad's mascara tears during her fight with Audrina in season 4 have become the GIF that keeps on GIF-fing from \"The Hills.\" But the producers actually received letters asking why she didn't wear waterproof mascara.\n\nThe mascara thing just happened, and it became a thing. Most of the time, when they were shooting, they would be sitting on their balcony, and the black eyeliner roll was their only device to tell stories.\n\nWe got so many letters that were like, \"Why didn't she wear waterproof mascara?\", and I never could answer that. I didn't know.\n\nIn conclusion, the cast of \"The Hills\" has finally revealed their biggest secrets and Scandals, including the infamous sex tape and Lauren's mascara tears.

The actress, who is currently showcasing her solo exhibition of oil paintings at downtown gallery Sargent's Daughters, admitted that she doesn't particularly enjoy weddings and that her own wedding was \"pointless.\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered when asked if she had fun at hers. \"I mean, it was fine, it was quick, it was simple, but it was pointless. Either you're throwing a party, or you're doing it out of necessity.\"\n\nDespite her strong opinions on marriage, Kirke left the door open for the possibility of getting married again, but only if she is not holding out any false hopes. \"It wouldn’t be under any delusions of thinking it would mean that it would improve anything or change things for the better,\" she said.",

Days after PEOPLE confirmed their split, Lena addressed the breakup during a livestream on Instagram, saying she was still wearing a ring that Jack had given her. \"I'll always wear it because love is a really cool, powerful, eternal thing,\" she said. \"It doesn't have to be defined the way that we, in Western culture, define it as beginnings and ends.\"\n\nTheir friendship is a testament to the power of love and friendship, and it serves as a reminder that even when things don't work out in a romantic relationship, the bond between two people can still last a lifetime.",

She hopes to see Betty \"have a good time\" and \"explore her sexuality more.\" In real life, Reinhart admits that she is \"very open sexually\" and loves to talk about it.\n\nMendes, on the other hand, says that she's \"never liked this idea of 'don't give him everything.'\" She believes that giving all of yourself in the bedroom is not as valuable as giving your love and intimacy.\n\nDespite their confidence, both actresses admit to having insecurities. Reinhart confesses that she struggles with feelings of inadequacy when she is with someone who has had more sexual experiences than her and has been in love more than she has. Mendes points out that one of her biggest hurdles was learning to speak up and be true to herself.\n\n\"It's easy to think you have to fit some kind of mold,\" Mendes says. \"But there's no way to mess up being yourself.\"\n\nRiverdale airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on the CW.

After graduating from Yale, she spent a few years doing theater in New York before making the move to Los Angeles in 2000 to pursue her dream of becoming a Hollywood actress.\n\nBut when she tried to join the Screen Actors Guild, she found out that an actress with the same name already existed. Determined to stand out, she took inspiration from her family and created a new name for herself. \"My first adoptive dad died when I was 15, and his best friend, Bill, did all the dad stuff with me, so I did a mushing of our names,\" she explained. \"I felt like I could get away with it because I'm Southern.\"\n\nAfter years of struggling to land roles, Young finally got her big break when she auditioned for the role of Mellie on Scandal. Although the character only had a few lines in the pilot episode, Young was thrilled to land the role and was even happier when she heard that she would be in about three episodes.\n\n\"I died inside when I heard that. But I kept a smile on my face and showed up to work every day,\" she said. \"At some point, they decided it was fun to write stuff for me. I'm having such a good time. I don't want it to ever end.\"\n\nFor more on Young's incredible journey, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday!",

According to Sheen, their passion for politics was what ultimately led to their separation.\n\nSheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the '30s, told the Daily Telegraph that the Brexit referendum was what inspired him to become more politically active. However, their desire to make a difference in the world led them to take different paths. Silverman, an American, wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, while Sheen, a Welshman, wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.\n\n\"We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions—because she is American and I’m Welsh,\" Sheen explained. \"After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.\"\n\nDespite the difficult decision to part ways, both Sheen and Silverman acknowledge that each of them had to do what they needed to do. Sheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales, aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.\n\nAs the Telegraph puts it, \"Sheen sounds a little wistful\" about the impact that politics had on his love life.

The producer has apologized for using statements by Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence in an attempt to dismiss a class action sexual misconduct lawsuit against him. Six women are suing Weinstein and what they call the \"Weinstein Sexual Enterprise,\" which they say includes his brother Bob and their co-founded studio The Weinstein Company. They allege that they conspired to conceal Weinstein's widespread alleged sexual harassment.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that, due to the scale of sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, his \"sexual enterprise\" should be considered an organized crime group. Lawyers for the Hollywood mogul filed a motion to dismiss the suit on Tuesday, arguing that it was \"fatally overboard\" and would apply to \"all women who ever met with Weinstein, regardless of whether they claimed to have suffered any identifiable harm.\"\n\nThey pointed to statements from Streep and Lawrence, who have both spoken out against the motion filed by Weinstein's lawyers. Streep has described the producer as a \"predator,\" while Lawrence has said that she stands behind the women who have survived his abuse and wants him to be brought to justice.\n\nA spokesperson for Weinstein said that he has directed his counsel to not use specific names by actors who have made previous public statements about him. He has also apologized for any pain or suffering caused by his actions.\n\nThe motion filed by Weinstein's lawyers has been met with criticism from Streep and Lawrence, who both believe that it is a desperate attempt to avoid accountability. The women in the lawsuit argue that the statute of limitations on the allegations does not apply because the alleged victims were under duress not to make the claims earlier.\n\nWeinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. The world is watching as this story unfolds, and many are hoping that justice will be served.",

The couple's on-again, off-again relationship has been the subject of tabloid headlines and social media chatter, but the details of what caused the latest breakup remain unclear.\n\nINSIDER spoke with relationship experts to get to the bottom of why getting back together with an ex is almost always a bad idea. According to April Masini, a relationship expert and online advice forum host, the couple's pattern of breaking up and getting back together is a bad behavioral pattern that can become a source of strain in their daily lives. \"Drama replaces problem solving and breakups become a very disruptive part of the relationship dynamic,\" Masini said.\n\nSusan Winter, another relationship expert and best-selling author, added that reuniting with an ex is typically not worthwhile unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted. \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" Winter said. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.\"\n\nRachel DeAlto, another relationship expert, agreed that getting back together with an ex is often more trouble than it's worth. \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" DeAlto said. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.\"\n\nDespite these experts' advice, it's possible that Evans and Slate may be following the same line of thinking that has led to their previous breakups. \"They're a great odd couple, and Hollywood loves an odd couple romance,\" Masini said. \"And they're not insusceptible to what fans love to see, which makes their issues even tougher.\"\n\nThe good news is that breakups can often lead to positive change. \"A breakup can be an enormous motivator to improve ourselves,\" Winter said. \"The clients that come to me and tell me they've lost somebody they love are so incredibly motivated to correct and change things about themselves and their personality.\"\n\nWhether Evans and Slate will heed this advice remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: getting back together with an ex is rarely the solution to relationship problems.",

The documentary promises to be an emotional and revealing look at the life of the late princess and the impact she had on those around her.\n\nPrince William said in a statement released by the network, “Part of the reason why Harry and I want to do this is because we feel we owe it to her. We couldn’t protect her, and we want to remind people of the character and person that she was.”\n\nPrince Harry echoed those sentiments, saying, “When she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite shocking. It was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing now looking back at it. It was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people. When you’re that young and something like that happens to you, I think it’s lodged in here, there, wherever – in your heart, in your head and it stays there for a very, very long time. I think it’s never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother, but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made, not just to the Royal Family but also to the world.”\n\nThe documentary will also feature interviews with family, close friends, political figures, and journalists, providing a comprehensive look at the life and legacy of Princess Diana.

The dress was actually a blue and black bandage dress from British retailer Roman Originals, but people saw it as gold and white or blue and black.

The audio clip was from an online dictionary entry, and the differing interpretations of the clip all had to do with how the brain interprets sound frequencies.\n\nJeremy Meeks, the \"hot felon\"\n\nIn June 2014, the Stockton Police Department released a mugshot of Jeremy Meeks, a 30-year-old inmate arrested on a weapons charge. Meeks' chiseled jaw and piercing eyes quickly made him a global sensation, and he was dubbed the \"hot felon.\" Meeks signed to a modeling agency and has since worked around the world.\n\nBeyoncé's pregnancy announcement\n\nWhen Beyoncé makes an announcement, the world stops to listen, and her early morning pregnancy announcement was no different.

Secondly, the narrative speculates on Brown's personal feelings and motivations without concrete evidence. Thirdly, the sensationalized tone of the message, including phrases like \"enjoys the attention\" and watching with popcorn, could suggest exaggeration or fabrication to attract attention.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears more likely to be a fabrication or speculative piece rather than a factual report. Therefore, I would return **0** as the prediction of its veracity.",
        "cs_rationale": "Based on the message provided, it seems highly unlikely to be a real statement from Chris Brown. Chris Brown's public image and past behavior have not typically involved publicly supporting or enjoying drama between other artists. He has had legal and personal issues that have often overshadowed his career and personal life. Moreover, the specificity of his supposed support for Pusha T and the details about Drake and Rihanna's past relationships seem fabricated for dramatic effect.\n\nAdditionally, reputable sources or credible news outlets have not reported such statements from Chris Brown. The content of the message appears sensationalist and designed to attract attention rather than convey genuine information about Chris Brown's opinions or actions.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, I would assess the veracity of the message as highly unlikely.

        "content": "Dwyane Wade, the star of the Miami Heat, has become one of the most highly paid basketball players in the world. With estimated net worths of over $100 million, it's hard to imagine the amount of hard work and dedication that has gone into his success.\n\nBut what exactly does Wade make his money from? The answer is simple: basketball and massive paychecks. Since joining the NBA in 2003-2004, Wade has made over $136 million playing the game he loves. His current contract pays him $15 million this season, with another $16.1 million due next season if he opts-in to his player option.\n\nBut Wade's success doesn't stop there. Along with LeBron James, Wade has mastered the art of taking short-term contracts to increase his flexibility and secure larger annual contracts. In 2014, he signed a two-year, $31.1 million contract with a player option, setting him up to be a free agent when the salary cap increases in 2016-2017. And when that time comes, Wade will be set to cash in on the biggest paydays of his career.\n\nHowever, even with all of his accomplishments, Wade was only the 21st highest-paid player in the NBA last year, according to ESPN. He made far less than players like Joe Johnson, Rudy Gay, and Brook Lopez. But that's not reason to feel bad for Wade, though. He's made tens of millions more in sponsorship deals, including a high-profile deal with a sports brand in China.\n\nOver the years, Wade has had sponsorship deals with Converse and Nike, but his biggest deal was with Chinese shoe company Li Ning. In 2012, he signed a 10-year deal with the company that few consumers know in the U.S., but which will pay him millions annually along with a reported $60 million stake in the company. It was a high-risk move for both Li Ning and Wade, and it's uncertain if it's paying off. Li Ning just reported its third straight year of losses, and its stock has gone almost nowhere since Wade signed the deal.\n\nOn top of Li Ning, Wade has had slightly less lucrative deals with Gatorade, Pepperidge Farm, Mission, and other brands. In total, Forbes estimates that he made $12 million in sponsorships last year.\n\nAdd it all up, and Dwyane Wade has made well over $200 million in his career. But after paying agents, managers, and living expenses, his net worth is likely significantly less than that. Estimates of his net worth are between $95 million and $115 million, and he has millions more coming in future years.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, Dwyane Wade has built a huge net worth and he'll likely add to it in years to come. And for those who have followed his career, it's clear that his success is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and willingness to take risks.",

Upon arrival, I discovered that the parlor floor, despite the unseasonable heat outside, was warmed by a roaring fire. As I waited, I realized that I was sitting in Harvey Weinstein's living room. He had purchased the six-story house in 2006, before marrying Chapman, and she had since transformed it with her style. The black floors and white rugs, chinoiserie, gilt, and glass, hydrangeas in a vase, and a Jo Malone candle completed the ambiance.\n\nA few weeks earlier, I had met Chapman at the Marchesa fashion company atelier, where she co-owns the business with Keren Craig. She appeared nervous and uncomfortable, mentioning that she had not been out in public for five months since similar accusations against her husband were made public. Today, she was more relaxed, though there was a sense of gallows humor. When I mentioned the warm weather, she quipped, \"Think of all the poor plants that are going to spring out and then die.\"\n\nWe moved downstairs to the ground floor, which was a large, open space with modern furniture and surprising art. There was a spacious kitchen that overlooked the backyard, and a TV room where Chapman's son Dash was sitting on a sectional encircled by some kind of electronic device. At 42, Chapman looked younger than in photographs, perhaps because she was more goofy than I had imagined. Although she retained her British accent, she was more laid-back than I had expected.\n\nOur meeting took place in Chapman's soon-to-be-ex-townhouse that had recently been sold by her soon-to-be-ex-husband. It was meant to be the first time she publicly addressed what happened with her husband. However, the night before our meeting, she called me late and sounded worried, apologetic, and unsure of whether she was ready to address difficult questions. I reassured her that we could discuss topics unrelated to her marriage to Weinstein.

The pictures were met with approval by Ciara's fans, who praised her for being confident and beautiful in her skin. One fan wrote, \"IN LOVE with this shoot and your hair!! Absolutely beautiful!! Keep on doing you girl.\" Another fan added, \"Being (a) mother don't stop you from living your life, and being happy, healthy and beautiful in your skin.\"\n\nCiara and Russell famously had a sex ban before they got married in England in July 2016.

The 57-year-old actor, who is set to star in the upcoming National Geographic series Genius: Picasso, caused a stir with his bold new look.\n\nAs fans of Banderas know, the actor is never one to shy away from a bold look. He has previously stunned in outfits that would make most people run for cover, and his Instagram page is proof that he's always willing to try new things.

Fans are left to wonder if this is simply a less jarring image of Banderas than that which will appear on screen, or if the two looks show Picasso at different stages of his life.\n\nSome fans are already speculating that Banderas is simply still finishing up filming for the series, which premieres on April 24th. But with his track record of late, which includes studying at the same storied fashion school as Alexander McQueen and creating his own line of candles, it seems that Banderas is always looking for change and trying new things.\n\nWhether Banderas is simply trying out a new look or if he's found his new signature style, one thing is for sure - he will always be a fan favorite.",

However, she also acknowledged that some fans may feel disappointed by this news, especially given the recent trend of movies teasing LGBTQ+ characters only to ultimately delivering weak or incomplete representation.\n\nThis trend is particularly evident in recent blockbuster films like Power Rangers and Beauty and the Beast, which made headlines for promising LGBTQ+ representation only to ultimately delivering throwaway scenes that felt disconnected from the rest of the story.\n\nFantastic Beasts has been praised for making great strides in LGBTQ+ representation, but the decision to leave Dumbledore's sexuality out of the film is a disappointment to many fans who had hoped to see a more fully realized version of the character on screen.",

Her lips appear to be plumped up, but this could be due to makeup rather than injections.\n\nBeyonce is in her 40s, and her face still looks young and smooth, without many wrinkles.

An added layer of sentiment came from being able to record the song in a Nashville studio, the city Taylor moved at age 14 to pursue country music.\" Spin has speculated on the reasons behind the edit, as well as Swift's alteration of the date in the song's opening line, which she changes from Sept. 21 to Sept. 28.\n\nSwift's comments on the other track remained unchanged in the press release: \"Delicate' is a song about the vulnerability that immediately surfaces in all of us the minute we meet someone we want to like us,\" it reads. \"We think about everything they might've heard about us, every reason they wouldn’t want us. Every step forward toward that other person scares us, but it thrills us too.

The two friends were recently spotted together for the first time in over five years, fueling rumors of a possible reconciliation.\n\nDuring a pre-Oscars weekend dinner in LA, Clooney was overheard telling guests that he was the one who convinced Pitt to reach out to Aniston. The actor has long been friends with both Pitt and Aniston, and was deeply saddened when they divorced in 2015. Clooney had maintained a close friendship with Aniston even after her divorce from Pitt, and reportedly stepped up his efforts to reconcile the pair when he heard that her marriage to Justin Theroux was on the rocks.\n\nClooney's involvement in the reunion has not been met without controversy, as some have accused him of playing matchmaker in the past. However, sources close to Clooney maintain that his motivations are purely platonic and that he is genuinely happy to see his friends reunited.\n\nDespite the rumors, Aniston and Pitt have not yet confirmed their status as a couple.

According to the Associated Press, Moore made the bold claim, \"I want Montana to be known as a decent state.\"\n\nDespite Moore's bizarre stance, the U.S. sales for yoga clothes have increased an astounding 45 percent year over year, while participation in yoga sports has only increased by a measly 4.5 percent. This means that more and more women are embracing athleisure wear as their go-to uniform, and for good reason - yoga pants are versatile, seasonless, and most importantly, comfortable.\n\nBut just because yoga pants are comfortable, doesn't mean they should be worn anywhere and everywhere. Here are some tips on how to wear yoga pants around town without getting the side-eye:\n\nDO: Learn from Lululemon's sheer pants recall. Make sure you select a pair that is truly opaque. Test them out in broad daylight or under bright lights.\n\nDON'T: Wear them to work. Ever. \"Dress Pant Yoga Pants\" is an oxymoron.\n\nDO: Invest in the correct size. It sounds like a no-brainer, but often women will purchase a size down to get a tighter fit or a longer shelf life since yoga pants stretch out. In reality, all you end up with is \"camel toe.\" Avoid at all costs.\n\nDON'T: Show your panty lines. If thongs aren't your thing, Commando and Zobha make great full-coverage bikini bottoms that are undetectable.\n\nDO: Layer up! Throwing on a leather jacket or a dark trench over your yoga pants and T-shirt will instantly dress up your look when you're running from bikram to brunch.\n\nDON'T: Keep wearing your favorite pair after the expiration date. Unlike jeans, yoga pants don't age well. Toss them when they're overly faded, stretched or ripped.\n\nDO: Accessorize! Nothing pulls together athleisure wear like a statement handbag and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nDON'T: Try to pull off your zaniest tie-dye yoga pants outside your ashtanga class. Stock up on neutral colors — navy, black, charcoal — that will go with anything.\n\nDO: Consider your tight-fitting yoga pants a thicker alternative to leggings in the wintertime. On the weekends, pair with knee-high boots and an oversized sweater, or wear them underneath a dress. No one will know the difference.\n\nTo shop the best yoga pants on the market, click on the slideshow below.",

Following her Best Actress Oscar win for 2003’s Monster, Theron was offered plenty of roles in action movies, but none of them quite fit her desired image of a no-nonsense female assassin. That is, until she came across the opportunity to work with director Karyn Kusama on Aeon Flux.\n\n“I got offered a lot of stuff in action movies that was either the girl behind the computer or the wife,” Theron revealed to Variety magazine. “When Aeon Flux came to me, I thought that could be something. I was never completely sold on the entire concept, but I really loved Karyn Kusama’s movie (Girlfight). So I threw myself into that with the belief that she’s a great filmmaker.”\n\nUnfortunately, their collaboration did not yield the desired results. The film received a lukewarm reception from critics and failed to make a significant impact at the box office. “And then we f**ked it all up,” Theron joked. “I just don’t think we really knew how to execute it. And it’s disappointing, but it happens. I’ve been in this business long enough to know that you cannot get it right every time.”\n\nDespite the setback, Theron was determined to take on the role of Lorraine Broughton in Atomic Blonde. And, after reading the script, she was immediately drawn to the character. “I might have gotten this right because of that (Aeon Flux),” Theron smiled. “You know nothing about this woman. It’s so rare that a female gets that in a movie.”\n\nFinally, Theron has the opportunity to play the perfect female protagonist, a tough as nails spy, and she’s convinced that Atomic Blonde will be a hit among fans and critics alike.

In an exclusive interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Keith Adams revealed that the entire stunt department was kept off set the day Thurman was allegedly pressured by director Quentin Tarantino to drive a vintage convertible at high speeds, resulting in a crash that left her with a concussion and damaged her knees.\n\n“Ms. Thurman’s accident was not a stunt,” Adams emphatically stated in an email to THR. “No stunts were scheduled for that day, and no one from the stunt department was called to set. I was not consulted or notified about Ms. Thurman driving a car on camera that day.”\n\nAdams, an experienced coordinator with a specialization in automotive work, added that if he had been involved, he would have insisted on using a professional driver and ensuring the car was road-worthy and safe. He did not specify whether he believed the stunt department was intentionally kept at bay to facilitate an actor performing dangerous driving maneuvers.\n\nThurman herself has described the 1973 Karmann Ghia as a \"death box\" and claimed that the incident was the result of a cover-up by production executives. The stunt coordinator's new statement underscores Thurman's account of the incident and highlights the dangers of allowing actors to perform dangerous driving stunts on set.\n\nMany people share safety duties on set, including producers, directors, and the stunt coordinator. However, in this case, Adams admits that he did not have the opportunity to intervene when changes to the shoot were made, leaving the safety of the cast and crew at risk.\n\n“On any set, my number one priority is the safety of the cast and crew,” Adams said. “Unfortunately, I did not have that opportunity in this case.”\n\nThis new revelation adds to the growing controversy surrounding the incident and raises serious questions about the safety protocols in place on set. The stunt coordinator's statement is a stark reminder of the risks actors face on set and the need for stricter safety measures to be put in place.",

The message describes shocking allegations made by the stunt coordinator of the Kill Bill movies regarding an incident that left Uma Thurman injured. The claims that no stunts were scheduled for that day and he was not consulted or notified about Thurman driving a car on camera. This supports Thurman's account of a cover-up by production executives and highlights potential safety risks on set. Overall, the message appears to provide specific details and quotes from involved parties, suggesting credibility.",

Adams explicitly denies any involvement of the stunt department on the day of the incident and emphasizes that proper safety protocols were not followed, which aligns with Thurman's description of events. His professional stance on prioritizing safety further supports the authenticity of his claims. Therefore, it is more likely that this message reflects real events rather than being fabricated. Hence, the prediction is 1.",

The heartbreaking suit claims that Luann breached a stipulation of settlement in her divorce by failing to create a trust “for the benefit of her two children.”\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by The Blast, Luann is being accused of failing to fulfill the terms of the divorce judgment. In the judgment, Luann was required to create a trust for her children, which she agreed to do. However, the documents allege that Luann has never created the trust and instead sold the deed of the former couple’s marital residence in Bridgehampton, New York, for $8 million.\n\nThe documents state that Luann used the earnings from the sale to purchase a home in Southampton, New York, for $3.1 million. The settlement required Luann to “fund the trust with an undivided one-half interest in and to the Marital Residence.” However, the documents claim that Luann has never conveyed this interest to her children, in trust.\n\nNow, Luann’s ex-husband and two children are seeking to enforce the judgment and prevent Luann from listing or selling the home. A representative for Luann did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n\nThis emotionally triggering news highlights the heartbreak and betrayal that Luann’s ex-husband and children are experiencing.

The resignations will be effective immediately, pending an investigation, according to a statement from interim chairman Dan Meyers.\n\nThe scandal began when internal emails were published by the Huffington Post, showing Haskell using derogatory language to describe Mallory Hagan, a former Miss America. In another email, Haskell forwarded a photo of Hagan with other former Miss Americas, joking about her physical appearance. Haskell and other officials have denied the allegations, calling the emails \"dishonest, deceptive, and despicable.\"\n\nThe resignations come after dozens of former Miss Americas signed a petition calling on the group's leadership to step down, accusing officials of \"sitting by without objection while such derisive comments were passed around.\" The petition called the emails \"despicable\" and demanded that officials take responsibility for their actions.\n\nThe resignations of Haskell, Weidner, and Randle are a first step in addressing the scandal, but many former Miss Americas and others are calling for a full housecleaning of the organization's leadership. \"We will continue to demand the resignations of every individual who either participated in the abuse of women or stood by and was complicit,\" Gretchen Carlson, 1989 Miss America, and Kate Shindle, 1998 Miss America, said in a statement.",

In fact, she put together a list of different products and toys that she had loved and sent that over to Heidi. \"I put together a little list of different products and toys that I've loved and sent that over to her,\" said Kristin.\n\nBeing a mother is a lot of work, especially when your boys are as rambunctious as Kristin's. \"My boys are so close in age, so one minute they're best friends and one minute they're hitting each other, punching each other,\" she said. \"They get very violent with each other...I think just right now, that's the hardest part.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Kristin is grateful for her beautiful family. \"They're so sweet, they're incredibly loving, and they love to cuddle and they love their mommy. And that's the best feeling in the entire world,\" she said.\n\nKristin also revealed that her daughter, Saylor, is a \"diva\" who loves to roughhouse and is very different from her brothers. \"She's a diva, but she's a ton of fun...She may as well be another boy because she's the third so she wants to do whatever the boys are doing.

Kidman's career in Australia would continue for a few more years, as she worked in both movies and TV.\n\nBut it was her international breakout role in 1989's Dead Calm that would change the course of her life. She portrayed the wife of a naval officer in the thrilling Australian thriller, and it was this movie that caught the attention of audiences worldwide and launched her into American cinema.\n\nHer arrival to the American movie industry was in the film Days of Thunder in 1990, where she met Tom Cruise, who would become her husband. They tied the knot on December 24, 1990, in Telluride, Colorado. They appeared together at the Academy Awards in 1991, where Kidman earned her first-ever Golden Globe nomination for her role in the film Billy Bathgate.\n\nHowever, their marriage was not meant to last. In February 2001, the couple announced their separation, and quickly after, they filed for divorce. It was a tough year for Kidman, but it was also a professional highlight, as her performance in the film Moulin Rouge earned her her first Oscar nomination and Golden Globe award, for best actress in a motion picture - musical or comedy.\n\nAfter her divorce from Cruise, Kidman found love again with the musician Lenny Kravitz, but their relationship was brief and intense. They were even engaged, but Kidman revealed in 2017 that they had called things off in 2004. Kidman spoke about a secret fiancé to Vanity Fair in 2007, saying \"It just wasn't right. I wasn't ready. We weren't ready.\"\n\nThings are all good between Kidman and Kravitz now. She told NET-A-PORTER.com's magazine, The EDIT, \"I love Lenny; he's a great guy.\" In 2006, Kidman married her current husband, Keith Urban, in Sydney, Australia. They have two daughters together, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret. Kidman continued her career success, earning Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for her film Rabbit Hole in 2011, and a Golden Globe nod for her film The Paperboy in 2013. And her show Big Little Lies with Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz, the daughter of her ex-fiancé Lenny Kravitz, earned her critical acclaim and numerous nominations.

        "content": "The biggest fashion faux pas for a wedding guest would be to upstage the bride. With all the attention and speculation surrounding Kate Middleton's gown for her upcoming royal wedding, it would be nearly impossible to do. However, there are other unwritten rules that guests should consider. Don't wear white, anything too revealing, or a hat that is too wide or tall to block the view of the person behind you. You can wear tasteful black, and be sure to cover your arms.\n\n\"This is not a place to make a fashion statement for yourself,\" said Sally Kilbridge, deputy editor of Brides magazine. She goes on to list more don'ts, including no miniskirts, plunging necklines, and novelty socks, which have become a surprising trend among guests at American weddings. The attire worn to a British royal wedding is appropriate daytime wedding attire kicked up many notches, Kilbridge said. Everyone's outfit should be chic, elegant, and suit the very formal, traditional occasion while not letting glitzy, black-tie, eveningwear trappings creep in.\n\nDesigner Reem Acra thinks Westminster Abbey could be the place for cocktail frocks, especially for celebrities and fashion editors who have long found reason to wear them before noon. The fashion role model for older women should be well-cut, luxe-fabric skirt suits, while Middleton's younger friends could pull off slightly retro, Hitchcock-inspired sheaths or pencil skirts paired with nipped-waist jackets. George Kotsiopoulos, co-host of E!'s Fashion Police, expects a lot of hats, but hopes they'll be toned-down cloches or a pillbox with a veil.\n\nVivien Sheriff, a British milliner who has made several dozen custom headpieces for wedding guests, said many guests will follow the lead of Middleton's mother, Carole, who is a fan of substantial hats. The hats Sheriff has made feature some feathers and crystals, but they're not oversized. \"You can't show off too much. You don't want to overdo it, but there is a lot of expression in the headpieces.\" Sheriff added that people aren't going to want to hide their faces, so the brims won't cover them. \"This way, everyone can get good photos and you can greet other guests looking them in the eye.\"\n\nThere will be more black than one might expect, Sheriff said. She had more orders for black than she expected. \"I guess fashion has changed and a lot of young guests want to wear black.\" However, black is fine as long as it's not funereal, according to Brides' Kilbridge, although the Middleton family won't wear it. Prince Charles' wife, Camilla, won't wear it either, Kilbridge predicted. Camilla will likely pluck something she already had in her closet, Kilbridge said, probably something not unlike the tailored dress and lovely coat she wore to her own wedding.\n\nMost of the male guests will likely don a navy or gray morning suit, which is basically the daytime equivalent of a tuxedo including a vest or waistcoat. All of William's military friends will be in uniform, Kilbridge said. A guest with a well-known personal style has a little more flexibility, said Kilbridge. It would be perfectly acceptable for Elton John, for example, to wear a flashy, embroidered vest under his jacket. Fashion fans will be eager to see David and Victoria Beckham, and Kilbridge thinks they won't disappoint, although she wonders how Victoria Beckham will dress her baby bump. \"They've had some crazy fashion moments, but this won't be one of them. She'll probably look fantastic. They want to create the impression that she belongs there. I think most people will be striving to look like they belong.\" That might have singer Joss Stone, who is famously barefoot almost everywhere she goes, digging to the bottom of her closet looking for a pair of shoes.",

Kaya Jones, 33, took to Twitter to expose the dark secrets of her former group mates, claiming that they were part of a prostitution ring that made them all rich while exploiting their fame.\n\n“I wasn’t in a girl group – I was in a prostitution ring!” Jones wrote, sending shockwaves across the internet. “Oh, and we happened to sing and be famous. While everyone who owned us made the $ – how bad was it? Bad enough that I walked away from my dreams, my band mates, and a $13 million record deal. We knew we were going to be #1.”\n\nJones, a Trump supporter, further alleged that the Pussycat Dolls’ “den mother” – a reference to the group’s mentor – was responsible for breaking the girls’ spirits and encouraging them to commit suicide. “Tell the public how you mentally broke us,” she wrote.\n\nBut Jones’ shocking claims didn’t stop there. She also accused the Pussycat Dolls of abusing their power and using drugs to control the girls. “After they turn you out or get you hooked on drugs, they use it against you,” she wrote. “That’s why I have so much respect for our military. I’ve been through way. But my scars you can’t see. At least real war is honest. Why don’t we report it?

I delivered the baby! I delivered her. I pulled her out.\"\n\nBut that's not all. Kris also shared that Kylie didn't feel much pain during the delivery. \"She just kept saying, 'I don't feel any pain,'\" Kris said. \"And you'd see the contractions like crazy and she would say, 'I'm just not feeling it,' and I would say, 'This is really weird.'\"\n\nKris's revelation comes as a surprise, as People magazine first reported Kylie's pregnancy news back in September 2017. But Kylie didn't personally confirm them until after she gave birth.\n\nKylie shared an Instagram post with fans as well as a 10-minute video of her pregnancy journey on YouTube. \"I knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress-free and healthy way I knew how,\" Kylie said. \"There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.\"\n\nKylie isn't the only sister who has had a unique baby delivery. Back in 2009, when older sister Kourtney gave birth to her first child with ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, Mason, the star famously pulled out her own baby during the delivery. In a 2016 interview with Today Extra, she revealed that it was her then boyfriend Disick who had filmed the birth that was aired on the family's reality show.\n\nKris is now a grandmother to nine grandkids.

What’s at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society. The Board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.\"\n\nMia Farrow, whose son Ronan recently published a New Yorker investigation with rape and sexual assault allegations against Weinstein's, took to Twitter to express her support of the board's decision. She wrote, \"I'm proud of the Academy for voting to expel Harvey Weinstein.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Weinstein's brother Bob spoke of his \"waking nightmare\" and expressed his desire for his brother to receive \"the justice he deserves.\"\n\nThe fallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal continues more than a week after an explosive New York Times investigation detailed decades of sexual harassment accusations against Weinstein.

The women stood together in solidarity, calling for greater representation and equal opportunities in the film industry.\n\nIn a joint statement, Blanchett and French director Agnes Varda emphasized the need for transparency and parity in executive bodies and work environments. They called for governments to enforce equal pay laws and for workplaces to be diverse and equitable. The women also acknowledged the efforts of those standing for change and called for the industry's stairways to be accessible to all.\n\nThe protest was part of the 5050x2020 movement, which seeks to achieve gender parity across all aspects of the film industry by the year 2020. The number 82 was selected to match the number of films directed by women in the festival's history, with only 4.3% of competition films in the past 71 years being directed by women.\n\nOther notable women involved in the protest included Salma Hayek, Marion Cotillard, director Patty Jenkins, and Haifaa al-Mansour. The protest was organized by French group Le Deuxieme Regard and the 5050x2020 collective, in collaboration with the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe protest comes in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #MeToo and Time's Up movements, which have sparked a renewed demand for change in the film industry. The movement also echoes broader calls for gender equality and diversity in the workplace.\n\nWhile progress has been made in recent years, with more women making the cut in competition, the statistics for women in Cannes are still dismal. Only one woman has won the Palme d'Or, and only one woman has been named Best Director. The festival has been criticized for its lack of diversity and inclusion, and for failing to provide a platform for women filmmakers.\n\nHowever, the rise of women in the film industry is undeniable, and the protest at Cannes highlights the need for continued efforts to promote gender equality and diversity in the industry.

The news surprised fans who had been speculating about the couple's potential divorce for months.\n\nAccording to a report by Radar Online, several factors contributed to the decision to end their marriage. One of these was Tatum's desire to have more children. Despite being the parents of a daughter, Everly, Tatum reportedly wanted a larger family. However, Dewan was not on board with this idea. A previous report by OK! Magazine suggested that Dewan wanted to return to acting and that caring for a newborn would interfere with her plans.\n\nAnother factor in the separation was reportedly the couple's differing views on family life. Although Tatum was earning enough money to support the family, he wanted Dewan to be at home with Everly so she would not be raised by nannies. However, Dewan reportedly grew tired of being a housewife while Tatum spent his time on movie sets.\n\nAdditionally, jealousy is said to have played a role in the separation. As Tatum's fame increased with films such as 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, and its sequels, he became a sex symbol in Hollywood, attracting numerous women. Sources claim that Dewan was uncomfortable with the way Tatum interacted with fans, including flirting with them in front of her.\n\nIn an official statement released via social media, Tatum and Dewan announced their separation and stated that they would not be making further comments on the matter.",
