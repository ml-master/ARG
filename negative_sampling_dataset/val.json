She admitted that she had struggled with thoughts of suicide in the past and wrote a song about it. \"I feel ashamed that I would have those thoughts, feel that low and that depressed,\" she said. \"You can be right or you can be loved. I just want to be loved.\"\n\nDuring the session, Perry was seen crying and mascara running down her face as she opened up about her past struggles.

He is still protected by 'family members' in Brazil. They've told lies to papers to try to silence me. To finally speak out and not be afraid.

So I thought if I can do that for one person then I owe it to my 12-year-old self.\"\n\nScodelario joins a growing list of women who have bravely come forward with their own stories of abuse, as the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across the world.\n\nActress Michelle Williams brought #MeToo founder Tarana Burke to the Golden Globes and opened up about navigating the uncertain times to help create a better world for the next generation, including her own 12-year-old daughter, Matilda Rose Ledger.\n\n\"I thought I would have to raise my daughter to learn how to protect herself in a dangerous world, but I think the work that Tarana has done and the work that I'm learning how to do ‚Äî we actually have the opportunity to hand our children a different world,\" Williams said on the E! red carpet pre-show. \"I am honored beyond measure to be standing next to this woman.

Stefani was wearing a white bikini top and a black sarong, while Shelton was wearing a blue trucker hat and board shorts.\n\nWhile they may have been an unexpected couple at first, Shelton and Stefani have been going strong for some time now. The source noted that the couple often visits Shelton's house in Oklahoma, where they spend time with Stefani's three sons from her previous marriage to Gavin Rossdale. Shelton acts as a father figure to the children and enjoys introducing them to country life.\n\nThe source also revealed that Shelton is devoted to Stefani and feels that everything in life happens for a reason. Although he was previously married to Miranda Lambert, he is now happy with the family he has with Stefani. The couple has not ruled out the possibility of starting a family together, but is happy with the family they have now.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight in October, Shelton gushed over his girlfriend and her whole family, saying that it has been fun for him to introduce them to country life.

Us has rounded up the best online reactions.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt on Monday, September 19, citing irreconcilable differences. She is reportedly requesting physical custody of their six children and joint legal custody.

Just like his mom, Meghan, Guy has been on an incredible journey.\n\nBefore Meghan adopted him in 2015, he was on the verge of being put down by a shelter in Kentucky. But thanks to Dolores Doherty and her rescue charity A Dog's Dream Rescue, Guy was given a second chance. Doherty brought him to an adoption event just outside Toronto, where Meghan was living while filming Suits. Little did they know, Meghan was one of the hopeful dog owners.\n\nGuy's journey didn't end there. After traveling 500 miles to the border, Doherty brought him to an adoption event, where Meghan finally adopted him. Meghan's other dog, Bogart, couldn't make the trip across the pond due to his age, but Guy has now moved to London with Meghan, a Kensington Palace rep confirmed in November.\n\nMeghan's love of dogs is something she shares with her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, who is known to be very fond of corgis.

Perhaps hanging out with her new four-legged friend, Guy, has helped fill that hole.\n\nMeghan and Guy's bond is obvious, and it's clear that they have a special connection.

Harry, Meghan's fianc√©, recalled in their first interview together, \"For 33 years, I‚Äôve been barked at, and this one walks in, and absolutely nothing, just wagging tails.\"\n\nTomorrow, Guy will be by Meghan's side again as they walk down the aisle in one of the most important moments of their lives.

He even delighted the crowd with a back flip during the show. After the performance, Michelle Visage, the drag race panelist, shared a photograph of herself embracing Garfield and Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox, captioning it with pride, \"Andrew Garfield, you are my new friend, I am SO proud of you for not just lip syncing Whitney tonight in a wig no less, but for opening your mind and heart to all it has to offer.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Garfield has donned drag.

On Monday, September 17, viewers will be treated to a night of emotional recognition as the winners are announced.\n\nThe major awards are divided into two categories: comedy and drama. On the drama side, The Handmaid's Tale, the freshman series that took home several awards in its first year, is once again in the running for Outstanding Drama Series. The grim, dystopian adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel was praised for its Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series. Additionally, the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series prize will be awarded to series star Elisabeth Moss, who has finally won an Emmy after seven prior nominations.\n\nOn the comedy side, the nominations field is crowded with eight series vying for the main prize. However, reigning champ Veep is missing as the show's final season was delayed while its star, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, underwent treatment for cancer. Among the contenders for the Outstanding Comedy Series throne are newcomer The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and the second season of Donald Glover's Atlanta. The rest of the Outstanding Comedy Series nominees include Barry, GLOW, Silicon Valley, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nWhile some shows were overlooked in certain categories, Killing Eve's star, Sandra Oh, made history as the first woman of Asian descent to be nominated for a Lead Actress Emmy.\n\nNBC will broadcast the 2018 Emmy Awards show live on Monday, with Saturday Night Live's Colin Jost and Michael Che hosting. The complete list of nominees can be found on the Emmys' website.\n\nAs the night of recognition approaches, let us take a moment to reflect on the emotional impact of television. From the laughter and tears that come with binge-watching a new show to the heartbreak and hope that comes with watching a character's journey unfold, television has the power to bring us together in a way that no other medium can.\n\nHere's to the winners and nominees of the 2018 Emmy Awards.

The plan had similarities to Jason's 2009 romantic comedy Couples Retreat in which four couples fixed their relationship woes together at a resort. Jennifer, 49, and Jason starred together in the 2010 comedy-drama The Switch. They later teamed up for the 2011 comedy Horrible Bosses and the 2014 sequel Horrible Bosses 2.

The specific claim about Lindsay Lohan campaigning to secure the role of Batgirl in an upcoming DC Comics movie seems a bit questionable.

It would be unusual for a high-profile role like Batgirl to be strongly pursued by an actress whose star power has significantly waned.\n\n2.

While it's possible that the two actors may have a casual acquaintance, the level of involvement described in the message is not typical of how casting decisions are usually made in the industry.\n\n3. The statement about Joss Whedon's preference for an unknown actress to play Batgirl seems to contradict the central claim of Lohan being a \"frontrunner\" for the role.\n\nGiven these inconsistencies and the speculative nature of the claims, I believe it is more likely that this message is a work of fiction or a rumor rather than a factual news report.

While RadarOnline.com covers celebrity news and gossip, its reliability can vary. It's generally considered a tabloid-style publication which may sensationalize or exaggerate stories.\n\n2. **Plausibility of Events**: Good Charlotte is a well-known band, and it's plausible that they could go on tour, especially if they have a new album (\"Generation Rx\"). The idea of celebrities influencing their spouses to tour is also within the realm of possibility.\n\n3. **Lack of Specific Evidence**: The message mentions struggling ticket sales but doesn't provide specific data or evidence (like actual ticket sales figures or venue capacities). This lack of detail makes it harder to verify the claim.\n\n4. **Nature of the Claim**: The claim itself (ticket sales struggling despite efforts) is plausible for any touring band, especially if there's competition or market factors affecting ticket sales.\n\nGiven these points, while the core claim (band touring and ticket sales struggling) is plausible, the specific details provided lack substantiation.

Creator Joe Henderson tweeted out that the axing \"fucking hurts,\" and star Tom Ellis tweeted that he was \"gutted\" by the cancellation.\n\nAs Netflix picks up the show, it is clear that the Peak TV era offers more choices where one outlet's miss is another's hit. It also is worth noting that Netflix didn't even have the SVOD rights to \"Lucifer\" - Hulu did - meaning that deal had to be reworked, similar to the way Amazon recently revived Syfy's \"The Expanse\" after having to renegotiate SVOD rights as the first three seasons were sold to Netflix.\n\nThis cancellation comes as Fox undergoes a dramatic shift amid its studio counterpart's pending sale to Disney (or Comcast). Gone are niche comedies like \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" and narrow dramas like \"Lucifer,\" as Fox plots a shift to broader audiences with a slate of procedurals and multicamera comedies. It is clear that the cancellation of \"Lucifer\" is a reflection of these changes, leaving many to wonder what the future holds for this beloved series and its dedicated fan base.",

Here‚Äôs why:\n\n1. **Content Style**: The message includes multiple references to potential plot details (\"introducing Charlize Theron's Cipher as a potential antagonist\"), speculation about behind-the-scenes drama (\"sparked rumors of behind-the-scenes drama among the costars\"), and playful suggestions for movie titles. This suggests a tone more akin to entertainment speculation rather than a straightforward news update.\n\n2. **Unverified Claims**: There are statements like \"Michelle Rodriguez's threat to leave the franchise\" and questions about whether Dwayne Johnson's spin-off will delay the mainline film. These are presented without clear attribution or verifiable sources, common in speculative entertainment reporting.\n\n3. **Lack of Authoritative Source**: While it mentions Entertainment Weekly confirming the new release date, the rest of the content lacks specific references to authoritative sources or direct quotes, which are typical in legitimate news reports.\n\n4. **Playful Speculation**: The list of potential movie titles and the comparison to past film releases (like Terminator 3 and Arnold Schwarzenegger) in relation to political events further suggest a playful and speculative nature rather than a serious news update.\n\nConsidering these points, the message seems more likely to be a speculative piece aimed at engaging fans rather than a factual news report.

This speculative tone suggests it may be more of a fan discussion or rumor rather than factual news.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears to be more of a fictional or speculative piece rather than a legitimate news report.

(Alas, it's not too late to book your ticket now to London‚Äîyou won't be able to attend the wedding itself, but you can still sort of camp out nearby and listen for sounds.)\n\nThere are countless spreadsheets and binders dedicated to making sure everything goes smoothly for Kate's sister's nuptials, and most of the plans remain shrouded in secrecy. And there are so many questions about the wedding itself, including what Pippa will be wearing, and what Kate's exact role will be, and whether or not we will be gifted with a shot of Meghan Markle and Prince George shaking hands. But what we do know, per a new E! report, is how Pippa, reportedly, has been preparing for the wedding.\n\nThe outlet claims that Pippa has undergone a \"strict bridal body boot camp,\" a three-month program run out of Grace Belgravia health club. The program, in its description, doesn't sound too different from an (intensive) gym membership that you might read about a famous person partaking in; the components include \"a personal trainer, skincare and leg toning treatments, plus yoga, pilates, spinning, cardio training, dance and meditation classes\" and \"the club also offers to arrange home deliveries of specialized healthy meals.\"\n\nOh, wait, there's also this, which sounds positively Paltrow-ian: \"The club also has a team of doctors and specialists who can help with anti-aging treatments including botox, peels, fillers, microdermabrasion and an assortment of laser treatments, as well as IV therapies.\" E! notes, of course, that it is \"unclear if Pippa has undergone such procedures.\"\n\nTheir source claims that Pippa has \"met with her PT about five times a week and mostly sticks to cardio and pilates.\" Per the source: \"She feels amazing. Her diet is the healthiest ever‚Äîshe hasn't even had a glass of wine in months. She's had facial treatments sometimes once a week or once a fortnight.\"\n\nThis truly is an impressive feat, as, just over the course of writing this post, we have finished off two glasses of wine and did not complete a single facial treatment.",

Scott Menaged, 40, operated a real estate investment business and retail furniture stores in Phoenix, Arizona, and had also appeared on the popular TV show.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona, Menaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme that involved embezzling millions of dollars in loans meant for real estate purchases. He also provided fake real estate purchase documents to conceal the fraud and used the embezzled money to support a lavish lifestyle, including travel, million-dollar homes, and luxury vehicles.\n\nWhen Menaged no longer had access to the embezzled funds, he orchestrated an elaborate identity theft scheme with the help of customers of his furniture stores. He used the personal identification information of recently deceased individuals and submitted fake credit applications from his furniture stores to various banks, resulting in more than $2 million in losses to the banks.\n\n\"Menaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme and brazenly stole from his victims ‚Äî their money, their identities, and ultimately their trust,\" said First Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth A. Strange in a prepared statement. \"Today's lengthy sentence is a fitting punishment for his egregious crimes.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow also ordered Menaged to pay victims more than $33.5 million in restitution. The investigation was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation.\n\nThis is a heart-wrenching story of a man who betrayed the trust of his victims and stole their identities to support his own luxurious lifestyle.

You get warning signs, and then you realize that you are not a tank, as (my wife) Ali says. Edge has this thing that he says about me, that I look upon my body as an inconvenience.\"\n\nWhile he does not want to discuss the details of his near-death experience, Bono acknowledges that it was a physical event that had a profound impact on him. \"It's just a thing that ... people have these extinction events in their lives; it could be psychological or it could be physical,\" he says. \"And, yes, it was physical for me, but I think I have spared myself all that soap opera.\"\n\nBono also reveals that his health scare was not the first time he has faced a life-threatening situation. In 2000, doctors wanted to biopsy him for throat cancer, but luckily everything turned out to be fine. He also broke his arm in a bicycle accident in 2014, which he calls a \"comic tragedy.\"\n\nDespite these close calls, Bono says that he has learned to keep some aspects of his life private. \"Especially with this kind of celebrity obsession with the minutiae of peoples' lives ‚Äì I have got out of that,\" he says. \"I want to speak about the issue in a way that lets people fill in the blanks of what they have been through, you know? It's one thing if you were talking about it in a place of record like Rolling Stone, but by the time it gets to your local tabloid it is just awful. It becomes the question that everyone is asking.\"\n\nUltimately, Bono says that his near-death experience has made him more aware of his own mortality and has inspired him to write about it in his music. \"Strangely enough, mortality was going to be a subject anyway just because it is a subject not often covered,\" he says. \"And you can't write 'Songs of Experience' without writing about that. And I've had a couple of these shocks to the system, let's call them, in my life. Like my bike accident or my back injury. So it was always going to be the subject. I just didn't want to be such an expert in it.\"",

She later witnessed Jolie become a dedicated philanthropist, having already been involved with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Jolie eventually adopted her first son, Maddox, in Cambodia.\n\nLansing also had a close working relationship with Tom Cruise, collaborating on movies such as the Mission: Impossible franchise and War of the Worlds. Cruise was like a \"brother\" to her and she trusted him completely. When Mission: Impossible II was delayed in 2005, Cruise reassured her and helped save the summer blockbuster.\n\nLansing also worked with Mel Gibson on his breakout film Braveheart, where she admired his passion for his work. She found him to be easy to work with despite their early disagreements.\n\nIn addition to working with these celebrities, Lansing was also present during filming of some of the greatest movies ever made, including Braveheart and Titanic.

These two competitors, who faced off in the season 25 finale, have found a new family in the DWTS community. As they prepare to co-host the pint-sized version of the competition, they reflect on their journey and the love they've found along the way.\n\n\"The opening number of the premiere episode on Sunday, I think people are going to fall in love,\" Muniz told reporters on the red carpet after the season finale. \"They‚Äôre going to go, 'Oh, this is for real. They can dance.'\" The 12 celebrity kids, ranging in age from 9 to 14, have brought Muniz and Fisher closer together, and they're excited to see them succeed. \"It is a true black hole of love, warmth, and genuinely rooting for each other,\" Fisher says of the DWTS family. \"They‚Äôve built this community unlike anything that I‚Äôve ever seen, and they‚Äôve all remained in each other‚Äôs lives.\"\n\nThe difference between this season and the original DWTS is striking. Juniors was pre-taped over the summer, allowing the kids to be out of school and giving the pro dancers the opportunity to serve as mentors. Cheryl Burke, Witney Carson, Sasha Farber, Lindsay Arnold, and Artem Chigvintsev are just a few of the pros who will be guiding the young dancers. The judging panel, too, has fresh faces, with Mandy Moore, Val Chmerkovskiy, and Adam Rippon joining forces to give the kids valuable feedback.\n\n\"It is a little bit different with the adults,\" Fisher admits. \"You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel. With the kids, I was so grateful that we had the judges that we did. Adam, Mandy, and Val did an unbelievable job at getting across some points they needed to get across, but from a place of nurture and of love and of expecting to see growth on the other end.\"\n\nThe kids have responded well to the critiques from the judges, and Fisher is proud of the progress they've made. \"I feel like it‚Äôs a little bit different with the adults,\" he says. \"You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel.

Paired with nude Aquazzura pumps, sunglasses, and a J.Crew basket clutch, Meghan was the epitome of elegance and sophistication.\n\nBut that wasn't all - Meghan was also seen making an entrance on the red carpet with none other than polo star Nacho Figueras and his wife Delfina Blaquier, who are close friends of Prince Harry and attended the royal wedding in May. The Sentebale chairman Johnny Hornby and CEO Cathy Ferrier were also in attendance, reports Richard Palmer, The Express' royal correspondent. The event took place at The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club in Windsor.\n\nMeghan has previously shown off her polo style at the Audi Polo Challenge in Ascot earlier this month, where she stunned in a brown gingham shirtdress with sandals and a panama hat for the first day, and a white button-down shirt and black pants for the second. And it looks like Meghan is a natural at polo, as Nacho previously told BAZAAR.com that Harry is \"very competitive\" and \"not an easy opponent.\" He also joked about the afterparty: ‚ÄúThe reception at the castle was great, and the second reception, I don't remember.‚Äù\n\nSo mark your calendars for this stunning couple's next appearance, and get ready to be dazzled by their elegance and charm.",

The temporary change was clarified by the model as a \"lil wig,\" showing her willingness to try out different hairstyles.\n\nKaia is often drawn comparisons to her mother, and shares similar features and long legs. In a recent outing with her parents and One Direction star Harry Styles, Kaia showed off an all-black ensemble and styled her hair in a short blonde wig. The picture was taken just hours after the family had lunch together at Cafe Habana in Malibu.\n\nHarry Styles has been spotted spending time with the Crawford/Gerber clan several times in the past, and the friendship between the families seems to be growing stronger. In 2014, Harry visited Cindy's home to meet her son Presley, who was recovering from surgery, and the family went on to enjoy some time together in Canada.\n\nCindy Crawford, who has graced the cover of Vogue Paris in April, was also seen enjoying lunch with Harry Styles and her husband Rande Gerber at Cafe Habana. The 50-year-old model was dressed in a casual cream blouse, paired with form-fitting jeans, while Harry sported a tropical-inspired shirt, skinny fit denim jeans, and suede camel boots.",

        "content": "The meteoric rise of Donald Trump and his seemingly unbeatable political prowess have left many experts stumped, seeking an explanation as to how this occurred. To fully understand this phenomenon, we must not only examine Trump himself, but also his devoted supporters, whose unwavering admiration and devotion to their unpredictable and often inflammatory leader baffles many.\n\nPsychologists and neuroscientists have provided numerous thought-provoking explanations for Trump's enduring support, but the accounts of these experts often vary greatly, sometimes overlapping and other times conflicting. However insightful these critiques may be, it is clear that further research and examination are needed to pinpoint the exact psychological and social factors driving this bizarre behavior.\n\nIn a recent review paper published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, UC Santa Cruz professor Thomas Pettigrew argues that five major psychological phenomena can help explain this exceptional political event.\n\n1. Authoritarianism: This refers to the advocacy or enforcement of strict obedience to authority, often at the expense of personal freedom. Those with authoritarian personality syndrome, a prevalent condition, often display aggression toward outgroup members, submissiveness to authority, resistance to new experiences, and a rigid hierarchical view of society. Trump's speeches, with their absolutist terms like \"losers\" and \"disasters,\" naturally appeal to those who prefer authoritarianism. Research has shown that Republican voters scored higher on measures of authoritarianism before Trump's rise, and a 2016 survey found that high authoritarians greatly favored Trump, leading to his election win.\n\n2. Social dominance orientation (SDO): This refers to people who prefer a societal hierarchy where high-status groups have dominance over low-status ones. Those with SDO are typically dominant, tough-minded, and driven by self-interest. Trump appeals to those with SDO by making clear distinctions between high-status groups (White) and low-status groups (immigrants and minorities). A survey found that those who scored high on both SDO and authoritarianism were those who intended to vote for Trump.\n\n3. Prejudice: While not all Trump supporters are prejudiced against ethnic and religious minorities, some certainly are. The Republican party has long used strategies that appeal to bigotry, such as \"dog whistles\" that signal prejudice to racists but not to others. Trump's shockingly direct appeals to bigoted supporters, such as calling Muslims \"dangerous\" and Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers,\" likely play a role in his popularity. A new study shows that support for Trump is correlated with a standard scale of modern racism.\n\n4. Intergroup contact: Contact with members of groups outside one's own has been shown to reduce prejudice. However, Trump's white supporters have experienced significantly less contact with minorities than other Americans. A study found that the racial and ethnic isolation of Whites at the zip-code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support, and this correlation persisted while controlling for dozens of other variables. Support for Trump increased with voters' physical distance from the Mexican border.\n\n5. Relative deprivation: This refers to the experience of feeling deprived of something one believes they are entitled to. Trump supporters who feel that American jobs are being lost to Mexico and China may be experiencing relative deprivation, particularly in swing states like Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This kind of deprivation is based on a skewed perception of entitlement, rather than an absolute lack of resources.\n\nThese psychological phenomena help explain the peculiar behavior of Trump's supporters, but further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.",

The story, as described by Liam Payne in an interview, suggests a specific sequence of events involving a request from Trump, refusal by the band's manager, and subsequent expulsion from the hotel.\n\nTo assess its likelihood of being real:\n1. **Specific Details**: The message provides specific details such as Trump calling their room and the manager declining the request. This adds some credibility.\n   \n2. **Source**: The claim is attributed to an interview with Liam Payne in Rollacoaster magazine, which would need verification to confirm its authenticity.\n\n3. **Plausibility**: While the incident could feasibly happen, it also could be a fabricated or exaggerated story for publicity or other reasons.\n\n4. **Contextual Clarity**: The message lacks direct evidence or corroboration beyond Payne's statement, making it reliant on the trustworthiness of the source.\n\nGiven these points, without further corroborative evidence, the veracity of the message remains uncertain. However, since the story includes specific details and is attributed to a named source in an interview, it leans towards being a real message rather than fabricated. Therefore, I would predict its veracity as **1** (more likely to be a real message).",

Therefore, the message is more likely to be false. Veracity prediction: 0.",

Despite claims that Meghan was present at the reception, no images have emerged to support this.\n\nIn the build-up to the wedding, there were reports that Meghan was advised not to wear anything similar to Pippa or Kate to avoid upstaging them. However, Meghan did not attend the ceremony.\n\nPippa and Meghan are rarely seen together, which has led some to speculate that they may be trying to avoid each other on the wedding day. Dr. Nyla Raja, a cosmetic dermatology GP and founder of Wilmslow Medispa, Manchester, believes that there may be similarities in their facial features, such as a similar eye shape, high cheekbones, and differences in lip size and jawline.\n\nHarry and Meghan have not revealed the guest list for their wedding reception, but it is expected to be significantly smaller than Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding at Westminster Abbey. The couple's closest friends, family, and celebrities, such as the Beckhams, Millie Mackintosh, and tennis star Serena Williams, are expected to attend.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Meghan reportedly attended a friend's wedding in Jamaica this weekend.

Jolie will not be present during or interfere with Pitt's custodial time.\n\nPitt will also have custody of the children from July 8 to July 14, when a doctor will be required to be present and will meet with the children before and after each two-day period. From July 21 to July 29, Pitt will resume custody of the children when he returns to California. The court noted that if the minor children remain closed off to their father, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with Jolie and may lead to primary physical custody being ordered in Pitt's favor.\n\nJolie's spokesperson has expressed disappointment at the release of confidential court records, stating that it is not in the best interests of the children. The spokesperson emphasized that Jolie has been focused on the children's health and needs throughout the divorce.",

We have been waiting for this for years, and now it's finally here. The season 7 finale aired on August 27, 2017, and we've been eagerly waiting for the next chapter.\n\nThrones' Season 7 finale was one of the most emotional episodes in the series, and we know that the eighth season will be no exception. We have seen the characters grow and change over the years, and we have been through their ups and downs with them.\n\nThe final season of Game of Thrones will be a farewell to an era of television, and we all know that it's going to be bittersweet.

        "content": "As the 75th Golden Globe Awards grace us with their presence this weekend, the anticipation is palpable. Hollywood's least serious award show is set to kick off the awards season, and while it may not hold the same weight as the Oscars, it often foreshadows the direction that the industry is heading in. Hosting the show this year is none other than Seth Meyers, who you may recognize from his NBC late-night show, \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\"\n\nThis will be Meyers' first time hosting the Golden Globes, but he's not exactly a stranger to talk show hosting. He'll be following in the footsteps of Jimmy Fallon, who hosted last year. NBC is marketing the show under the tagline \"Hollywood, we have a lot to talk about,\" so expect lots of humor and not-at-all uncomfortable and awkward moments about the recent turmoil in Hollywood over sexual harassment and abuse.\n\nMeyers spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about taking on the gig, revealing that he discussed it with his wife and women on his writing staff. He saw it as an opportunity to \"say some things that you wouldn't be able to say in previous years.\"\n\nOn the film side of things, The Shape of Water leads with seven nominations, followed closely by The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, both with six nods. Lady Bird is also up for several big awards, although not for Best Director, which once again overlooked all female directors.\n\nThe TV awards are more widely distributed, with HBO's Big Little Lies leading with six nominations, but it's up against a slate of other prominent prestige shows, including The Handmaid's Tale, This Is Us, Master of None, Stranger Things, and The Crown.\n\nThe ceremony will begin at 5PM PT / 8PM ET on Sunday, January 7th, and will take place at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The show will be broadcast live on NBC, as it has been since 1993. If you're in need of some extra glamour, you can tune in an hour earlier for the red carpet arrivals, which will be streamed exclusively on Facebook.\n\nSo how do you watch? If you have NBC, you can watch through an over-the-air antenna, cable, or satellite. If not, fear not! This year, NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have reached a deal to allow for online streaming of the awards show. Simply head to NBC's app or website, or check your cable or satellite provider for online access. And if you're not a subscriber, most of these services offer free seven-day trials, so you can give it a shot without committing to a long-term subscription.\n\nTwitter will also be a great resource for following along with reactions and memes in real time, and The Verge will be reporting live on the night, with a running list of winners, reactions, and other news. So gather around the TV, gather round the internet, and let's celebrate Hollywood's finest.",

After 40 hours of labor, he was delivered via C-section at the hospital.\"\n\nJill, 26, and Derick Dillard, 28, are already parents to Israel, 2, and announced they were expecting a baby boy in January. \"We‚Äôre really excited about having another son,\" Derick said at the time. \"I know that Israel and this little one will be best friends. ‚Ä¶ Thank y‚Äôall for your well wishes. We‚Äôre so excited about this new blessing from God.\"\n\nThe Duggar family has been making headlines lately, and not all of it is good. The 19 Kids and Counting stars have been dealing with controversy over their strict parenting methods and their stance on modern technology. But one thing they can all agree on is how adorable their new addition is!",

Several indicators suggest this:\n\n1. **Use of Unnamed Sources**: The information is attributed to an unnamed source from OK! Australia, which is a tabloid known for sensationalized stories rather than reliable journalism.\n\n2. **Emotional Language and Dramatic Claims**: Phrases like \"screaming and in tears,\" \"deeply offended,\" and claims of relationship turmoil are typical of tabloid gossip meant to attract attention rather than convey factual news.\n\n3. **Contradictory Information**: Despite claims of relationship discord, there is a counterclaim that the couple appears more in love than ever, supported only by a social media post. This contrast adds to the sensational nature rather than lending credibility.\n\n4. **Historical Context and Rumors**: Mentioning past relationship history and ongoing rumors about their wedding plans (Las Vegas or Australia) without concrete evidence further aligns with tabloid speculation rather than verified facts.\n\nConsidering these points, the message lacks verifiable sources, contains emotional language typical of tabloid narratives, and includes speculative information.

Her childhood years were spent at Graymont, the family home in Richmond, before she attended boarding school at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. It was here that she met her first husband, Topper Mortimer, and they began a love story that would take them to the pinnacle of society. Together, they moved to New York City, where Tinsley attended Columbia University and graduated with a degree in art history.\n\nAs soon as Tinsley landed in New York, her stunning blonde hair, her Southern charm, and her innate ability to build a personal brand propelled her into the spotlight. She quickly became the most photographed woman in the city, synonymous with the New York social scene. After working at Vogue, she transitioned to a career in public relations, always an entrepreneur at heart. She built a successful personal brand that was launched with a line of handbags, Samantha Thavasa by Tinsley Mortimer, a clothing collection, Riccimie by Tinsley Mortimer, which was sold exclusively in Japan, and a tabletop collection.\n\nTinsley then became the beauty ambassador for the iconic French fashion design house of Christian Dior and helped to create a lip gloss coined Tinsley Pink. She published her first novel, Southern Charm, and made her television debut in the hit TV show Gossip Girl in 2010. When she and Topper divorced, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City. A respite in Palm Beach gave her time to reflect on her accomplishments, and in late 2016, Tinsley decided to move back to New York City and prove that there is more to her than meets the eye.\n\nOnce back in the city she loves, she channeled her energy into her charity efforts, including supporting the Best Friends Animal Society. She is the celebrity ambassador for ‚ÄúNo Dogs Left Behind,‚Äù a global animal rescue organization and flew to Beijing on behalf of the charity last year. Tinsley brought five rescues back to the states with her and adopted two from the group, naming them Strawberry & Shortcake.\n\nIn 2018, Tinsley teamed up with the cosmetic brand Winky Lux, to create her own collection titled XXO Tinsley for Winky Lux. She launched with a range of eyelashes in three different sizes, a giftset titled a Wink & Kiss, and created her favorite shade of lip gloss, appropriately titled Vodka Cran.\n\nNow that Tinsley is finally back and settled into her New York groove, she is ready to open herself up to finding the perfect match with whom she can continue to build her empire and share her special love for animals.",

Kelly has released a new 19-minute song, \"I Admit,\" addressing the sexual abuse claims against him and revealing the personal troubles that have plagued him throughout his career.\n\nThe track, which was posted to Soundcloud on Monday, begins with the lyrics, \"I admit I have made some mistakes/And I have some imperfect ways.\" Kelly then gets personal, singing that he likes \"all the ladies, that's both older and young ladies,\" followed by the statement, \"But tell me how they call it pedophile because that (expletive) is crazy.\"\n\nThe embattled entertainer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has long been accused of behavior that has ranged from questionable to criminal. He was accused of child pornography after a widely circulated videotape appeared to show him having sex with, and urinating on, a teenage girl. He was acquitted of all charges in 2008 and continued to rack up hits and sell out stadiums around the country.\n\nOn \"I Admit,\" Kelly sings that he's \"not convicted, not arrested, dragged my name in the dirt/All this work to be successful, when you abandon me 'cause of what you heard.\" The song also reveals that he was sexually abused as a child, with the lyrics, \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nKelly is one of pop music's best-selling artists and his hits include \"Ignition,\" ''I Believe I Can Fly,\" ''Step in the Name of Love\" and \"Bump N' Grind.\" He has also written hits for artists ranging from Celine Dion to Michael Jackson to Lady Gaga. While he's written classic love songs and even gospel music, he is defined by sexually explicit songs such as \"Feelin' on Yo Booty,\" ''Your Body's Calling Me,\" ''Sex Me\" and even more explicit fare.\n\nOn the new song, he says he was sexually abused as a child, singing \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nThe song has sparked outrage on social media, with celebrities and activists condemning Kelly and calling for his arrest. Rapper Talib Kweli Greene said in a Twitter post, \"His lack of self-awareness is atrocious. There are several lyrics I take offense to. The one I will address is 'I‚Äôm just a man.' I am also a man. I would never use that to defend this behavior.\"\n\nIn conjunction to the #MeToo movement, Viola Davis, Shonda Rhimes and Ava DuVernay and other celebrities participated in the Time's Up movement's #MuteRKelly social media campaign in April, calling for a boycott of his music and performances.\n\nKelly's concert in his hometown of Chicago was canceled around the time the Times' Up campaign took aim at the singer over allegations he sexually abused women. Weeks later, Spotify removed his music from its playlists, citing its new policy on hate content and hateful conduct.\n\nThe song was not released on Sony's RCA Records, where Kelly is signed. The label said it had no comment about the song. Kelly posted a link to the song Monday with the caption: \"Today is the day you've been waiting for.\"\n\nIn May, a woman filed a lawsuit against Kelly, accusing the singer of sexual battery, knowingly infecting her with herpes and locking her in rooms for punishment.\n\nKelly's new track is a bold move, but it's unclear if it will be enough to save his career, which has been put on hold due to the sexual abuse claims. The #MeToo movement has exposed the dark side of the entertainment industry and Kelly's admission may not be enough to repair the damage to his reputation.\n\nKelly's fans will have to decide if they can forgive him for his past mistakes and support him moving forward. Only time will tell if Kelly's admission will be enough to save his career and repair the damage to his reputation.",

As hinted at in a promotional campaign that resembled pharmaceutical advertising, the album is set to arrive on December 15th, just over four years since the release of \"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\" in 2013. Make sure to update your year-end lists to reflect this emotional milestone.\n\nIn recent weeks, Eminem has given us a new collaboration with Beyonc√©, \"Walk on Water,\" left us to ponder why Donald Trump did not respond to his powerful anti-Trump freestyle at the BET Hip-Hop Awards, and took the stage on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nDr. Dre first shared the release date for \"Revival\" in a heart-wrenching faux drug commercial, captioned with the words \"Use as prescribed by your doctor.\" Watch it below and let yourself feel the emotion.",

Gomez has not commented on her decision to join the movie directed by Allen, which does not have a premiere date. At least three stars of the movie, Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Hall, and Griffin Newman, have vowed to donate their income from the movie to different charities supporting women and the Time's Up movement.\n\nMeanwhile, actor Alec Baldwin has come out in support of Allen, tweeting that he was investigated forensically by two states and no charges were filed. Teefey's comment about her daughter working with Allen comes during the same week where she told Gossip Cop she's \"not happy\" about Gomez rekindling her relationship with on-and-off boyfriend Justin Bieber.",

In October 2015, Vance Jr. declined to press charges after investigating whether Weinstein groped Italian model Ambra Battilana. Asia Argento, who has accused Weinstein of sexual assault, expressed hope for justice on Friday, stating, \"We, the women, finally have real hope for justice.\"\n\nWhile the New York charges are the first against Weinstein, several other cities have also launched investigations into the producer in the wake of the allegations.

Get the Scoop on His Lavish Lifestyle and Divorce Settlement with Kelly Clarkson!\"\n\nIf you've been following the latest celeb gossip, then you've probably heard of Brandon Blackstock. This American talent manager has a net worth of a staggering $10 million, making him one of the richest people in the business. But how did he get so rich? And what's his life like? In this exclusive article, we'll reveal all the details on Brandon's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about Brandon's net worth. As a talent manager, he's worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Kelly Clarkson. And it seems that his hard work has paid off big time. In 2023, Brandon was awarded a whopping $10 million net worth, making him one of the wealthiest people in the business.\n\nBut how did he get so rich? Well, Brandon has been in the music industry for over a decade, starting out as a talent agent for his stepmother, Reba McEntire. He later formed his own talent management company, Starstruck Entertainment, which manages the careers of many successful musicians and actors.\n\nBut Brandon's success didn't stop there. In 2013, he married Kelly Clarkson, the stunning singer and winner of American Idol. Together, they have two children and a luxurious lifestyle. In 2018, they lived in an $8 million mansion in Encino, California, before Kelly bought a $10 million mansion in the same neighborhood.\n\nBut things didn't go as smoothly as planned in their marriage. In 2020, Kelly filed for divorce from Brandon, citing irreconcilable differences. But before things could get too far, Brandon filed for spousal and child support, asking for $436,000 per month. A judge eventually ordered Kelly to pay him $45,000 per month in child support and $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years. She also had to pay him $1.2 million to cover his legal expenses.\n\nBut things got even more complicated when Kelly claimed that Brandon had defrauded her during his 13 years as her manager. She accused him of overcharging her millions of dollars and not being licensed to operate as a talent agent. Brandon's company, Starstruck Management Group, countered by pointing out that Kelly was always properly represented by her separate talent agency, CAA.\n\nIn the end, an LA judge sided with Kelly, ruling that Brandon had indeed overcharged her. But despite this setback, Brandon still walks away with a net worth of $10 million, proving that he's one of the most successful talent managers in the business.\n\nSo there you have it, folks. The inside scoop on Brandon Blackstock's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate. From his days as a talent agent to his current net worth of $10 million, Brandon Blackstock has come a long way. And with his stunning wife and two beautiful children, he seems to have it all.",

Nearly half of the board has resigned or been forced to resign in the aftermath, and 22 state pageant leaders are seeking to oust Chairwoman Gretchen Carlson over concerns about the pageant's new direction.\n\nGretchen Carlson, a former Miss America and a champion of the #MeToo movement, made the heart-wrenching decision to drop the swimsuit and evening-gown competitions on June 5th. She explained that the decision was made in an effort to create a more inclusive and empowering experience for the contestants, and to shift the focus of the pageant back to the interview portion of the competition.\n\nHowever, this decision has caused deep hurt and anger among those who have long held the Miss America contest to be a symbol of beauty and self-confidence. The elimination of the swimsuit and evening-gown competitions has been met with widespread criticism, with many arguing that it waters down the pageant's original appeal and purpose.\n\nAs a result, Gretchen Carlson has come under fire from 22 state pageant leaders who are seeking to oust her from her position as Chairwoman. They argue that Carlson's decision to eliminate the swimsuit and evening-gown competitions goes against the pageant's core values and has caused irreparable damage to the organization.\n\nThis emotional and divisive situation has left many former contestants and pageant fans feeling heartbroken and disillusioned. The Miss America contest has always been a source of pride and inspiration for those who have participated in it, and the recent events have left many feeling like their beloved institution has lost its way.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it is clear that the Miss America organization is facing a difficult and emotional time.

After months of speculation, Jenner released a 10-minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her child. The announcement comes after months of speculation and a Calvin Klein campaign by all the Kardashian sisters that convinced fans that Jenner was expecting a child.\n\nFollowing the announcement that Khloe Kardashian is pregnant with her first baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, fans have been calling on Jenner to confirm the news. Some fans were frustrated that she didn't confirm it in a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, when Kardashian told her she was pregnant. Jenner and her boyfriend Travis Scott have been spotted looking loved up and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, indicating that they are still together.\n\nFans have been speculating about Jenner's pregnancy for months, with some pointing to an old social media video from the Golden Globes where they claim to see a baby bump. Photos taken \"months ago\" from her friend's birthday party also show Jenner in an oversized jumper, concealing her figure. The absence of Jenner from social media led to rumors that she had split from Scott, but a recent video put these rumors to rest.\n\nAfter 24 days of snippets from the famous Kardashian Christmas card, fans were convinced day 25, Christmas Day, would be the big reveal. However, Jenner was nowhere to be seen at all, leaving fans sure that she was heavily pregnant. Fans were still convinced a baby announcement was on the way after spotting a \"clue\" in one of the Kardashian Christmas calendar photos.\n\nDuring the upcoming Christmas special of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris Jenner revealed what she was most thankful for ‚Äì and got very emotional. \"I used to pray that one of you guys would have a baby and now it‚Äôs like a faucet that we turned on that won‚Äôt turn off,\" she confessed. \"The fact that I have all these grandchildren...\" Fans couldn't help but make the connection following Jenner's pregnancy reports.\n\nIn pictures obtained by The Sun, a marquee lined with pink curtains can be seen set up at the back of Jenner's LA mansion, showing pink decorations filling the garden. Pink objects appear to be floating in the pool, while matching cushions adorn the seating area. Jenner appeared in pink silk pyjamas, suggesting the baby shower was for herself and she is expecting a baby girl.\n\nFans are convinced they know when Scott found out the \"happy news\" from Jenner, who has a huge net worth. On June 12, the star cryptically tweeted: \"Legit the happiest day of my life.\" According to Perez Hilton, this would coincide perfectly with the reported due date, and the pair went on to get a matching butterfly tattoo.\n\nPeople magazine originally reported that Jenner was due to give birth in February 2018. A source said: \"They started telling friends a few weeks ago. The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis!\" Another insider added: \"It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about. Everyone is overjoyed for her. This is the happiest she‚Äôs ever been.\"\n\nJenner has not confirmed or denied her pregnancy, but reports have already begun speculating about what she would name her future child. An alleged insider told Hollywood Life: \"She would like to do something both unique and keep the 'K' first name consistent with her sisters and mum.\" Fans thought she may have gone with the name Butterfly given that she and Scott both have matching small butterfly tattoos on their ankles. Jenner told Elle UK in December 2015 that she would delete her account as soon as she has a child. \"Once I have a kid, I‚Äôm not going to be on Instagram,\" she said. ‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôll probably delete my Instagram and just...

Selena is credited as the songwriter of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,\" and she did interviews where she discussed her songs, including their meanings.\n\n2. **Claim 2: The song was inspired by Chris P√©rez joining Los Dinos.**\n   - Veracity: Likely true. Selena and Chris P√©rez's personal and professional relationship was well-known, and it's plausible that significant events in their lives influenced her music.\n\n3. **Claim 3: The song became more popular after Selena's death and was covered by Jennifer Lopez and Kat Von D.**\n   - Veracity: True. Selena's tragic death in 1995 led to increased popularity of her music, including \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,\" which has indeed been covered by various artists, including Jennifer Lopez.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears to be describing known and verifiable facts about Selena, her songwriting process, and the cultural impact of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.\" Therefore, the veracity assessment leans towards it being a real message.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nVeracity assessment: 1",

This claim could potentially be verified through historical records, interviews, or documented sources from that time period. Selena was indeed known for her songwriting abilities, so it is plausible that she could have written the song.\n\nSecondly, the message mentions that Selena described \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" as the sound of the heart when it sees a man pass by, and she wrote it after Chris P√©rez joined Los Dinos. This detail aligns with known facts about Selena's personal and professional life, including her relationship with Chris P√©rez, which lends credibility to this part of the story.\n\nThirdly, it states that \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" gained increased popularity after Selena's death and has been covered by Jennifer Lopez and Kat Von D.

With the midterm elections just around the corner, the speech has become a vital opportunity for the president to sway voters and address the issues that are on the minds of Americans.\n\nThe speech is expected to focus on immigration, border security, infrastructure, tax changes, and strong economic growth in the U.S., as well as the benefits of the recently enacted tax changes and an America-first trade policy. The president will also highlight a national security policy of ‚Äúpeace through strength,‚Äù and use the opportunity to reveal the details of his long-awaited infrastructure plan.\n\nWhile the president has demonstrated considerable unpredictability in his first year in office, straying from scripted speeches and creating headaches for his staff, it remains to be seen whether he will deviate from the script on Tuesday. With the overall advantage for Democratic candidates over Republicans in the polls, lawmakers have a narrow window for swaying voters, and could face praise or backlash from their constituents, possibly affecting election results this fall.\n\nThe guest list for the State of the Union has been revealed, with the president and first lady inviting 15 special guests, ranging from workers and business owners who have benefited from the economy, to parents of gang-violence victims, to military members and public servants, to volunteers.

        "content": "The beloved veteran actor, Tom Hanks, spoke to The New York Times about the recently uncovered allegations of harassment and assault against Harvey Weinstein. Despite never working with Weinstein, Hanks expressed his disgust and shock at the allegations.\n\nWhen asked why Hollywood ‚Äúsheltered‚Äù Weinstein despite rumors of his inappropriate behavior, Hanks rejected the excuse that his behavior could be considered old-fashioned. He asked, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs a really good question and isn‚Äôt it part and parcel to all of society somehow, that people in power get away with this?‚Äù\n\nHanks emphasized that power in Hollywood can be rather manipulative. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can,‚Äù the actor said.\n\n‚ÄúThey think their achievements entitle them,‚Äù Hanks said, proceeding to reference a quote about power. ‚ÄúSomebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: ‚ÄòWhen you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are,'‚Äù Hanks said.\n\nHanks agrees with the quote, saying he supports the negative backlash against the movie mogul. ‚ÄúI would say, there‚Äôs an example of how that‚Äôs true. Just because you‚Äôre rich and famous and powerful doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away ‚Äòfat,'‚Äù Hanks said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not, you know, I‚Äôm not the first person to say Harvey‚Äôs a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey ‚Äî I‚Äôm not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn‚Äôt it kind of amazing that it took this long? I‚Äôm reading it and I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don‚Äôt do that. That ain‚Äôt fair. Not her, come on. Come on!‚Äù\n\nHanks also commented on the sexism that continues to exist within Hollywood, referring to the show Mad Men, to which he says ‚Äúhad absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period.‚Äù He explained, ‚ÄúThose people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, ‚ÄòHey, wait, that‚Äôs going on today? Shouldn‚Äôt we be on this?‚Äô Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it‚Äôs happening? I can‚Äôt quite believe that.‚Äù\n\nThe actor joins other Hollywood stars, such as Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Patricia Arquette, Leonardo DiCaprio, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Lawrence, in speaking out against Weinstein. The backlash against Weinstein includes him being suspended by BAFTA, fired from The Weinstein Co., and having his $5 million endowment rejected, intended for USC‚Äôs School of Cinematic Arts ability to grant scholarships to female directors.

With over 435 episodes, Grey's Anatomy has surpassed even The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, which ran for 15 seasons and 435 episodes. Only seven dramas in the history of television have had more seasons than Grey's, including Gunsmoke, Law & Order, NCIS, CSI, and ER.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made official at the wrap party for the Shonda Rhimes drama, where ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey praised the show's loyal fans and the new generations of viewers who continue to discover the joy and drama of Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made possible thanks to a new two-year deal signed by star Ellen Pompeo, who remains the highest-earning actress on a drama series. The deal includes a seven-figure signing bonus, two full backend equity points on the show, and producing fees on both the flagship series and spinoff Station 19.\n\nGrey's Anatomy has become increasingly important for ABC since creator Shonda Rhimes left her longtime home at ABC Studios for a nine-figure deal with Netflix. Rhimes has since handed off day-to-day control of the show to Krista Vernoff, who has helped creatively recharge the series and Pompeo.\n\nThe current 14th season ranks as ABC's No. 1 drama among the advertiser-coveted adults 18-49 demographic and No. 2 at the network among total viewers. With Pompeo, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson, and James Pickens Jr. all set to return for season 15, along with co-stars Kevin McKidd, Jesse Williams, Caterina Scorsone, Camilla Luddington, Kelly McCreary, Giacomo Gianniotti, Sarah Drew, and Jessica Capshaw, Grey's Anatomy is set to continue its reign as the longest-running primetime drama in history.\n\nGrey's Anatomy joins a roster of ABC shows set to return for 2018-19, including comedies The Goldbergs, Modern Family, and Roseanne, as well as the previously renewed Good Doctor. Those join new pickups including the 1990s-set Goldbergs spinoff, Nathan Fillion drama The Rookie, and Take Two, with the latter likely set for this summer.",

The mention of a Moscow gynecologist advising against following the Duchess's quick departure from the maternity hospital further adds to the narrative.\n\nTo assess the veracity of this message, we can consider several points:\n1. **Plausibility of Conspiracy Theories**: It's not uncommon for conspiracy theories to circulate around high-profile events like royal births. However, the specifics mentioned (surrogate mother, doubts about the birth itself) seem sensational and lack credible evidence.\n\n2. **Media Reporting**: The message mentions that it has been reported that these theories are circulating in Russia. Without specific sources or verifiable reports, it's challenging to confirm the accuracy of these claims.\n\n3. **Commonsense Evaluation**: While conspiracy theories can arise, the claims made (such as the involvement of a surrogate mother and doubts about the birth) typically require substantial evidence to be taken seriously. In the absence of such evidence, these claims lean towards being speculative rather than factual.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears to describe a situation where conspiracy theories are being discussed rather than presenting verified facts.

This was not the first time these two men had faced off, as they are scheduled to meet in a boxing match on December 1st.\n\nBut there is more to the story than meets the eye. One of the men, Deontay Wilder, is in a relationship with Telli Swift, a former reality star and model. Telli is a nurse by education and a former beauty pageant competitor. She and Wilder have two children together and are raising them in support of the Spina Bifida Association.\n\nTelli's modelling career began at the age of three, and she has lived and worked all over the world. She is fluent in three languages and has always been passionate about using her platform to raise awareness about important issues. With Wilder by her side, she continues to inspire others and make a difference in the world.\n\nAs they prepare for their upcoming match, it is clear that both men are deeply committed to their craft. They have faced numerous challenges throughout their careers, but they have always come back stronger. Their love for boxing is matched only by their love for each other and their families.\n\nLet us hope that this match will be a display of their skills and a testament to their dedication. Let us also hope that it will inspire others to follow their dreams and never give up on their passions.",

The British actor Michael Sheen and the comedian Sarah Silverman, known for their shared anti-populist views, have called it quits after four years of being in a relationship. According to Sheen, their passion for politics was what ultimately led to their separation.\n\nSheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the '30s, told the Daily Telegraph that the Brexit referendum was what inspired him to become more politically active. However, their desire to make a difference in the world led them to take different paths. Silverman, an American, wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, while Sheen, a Welshman, wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.\n\n\"We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions‚Äîbecause she is American and I‚Äôm Welsh,\" Sheen explained. \"After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.\"\n\nDespite the difficult decision to part ways, both Sheen and Silverman acknowledge that each of them had to do what they needed to do. Sheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales, aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.\n\nAs the Telegraph puts it, \"Sheen sounds a little wistful\" about the impact that politics had on his love life.

On his 43rd birthday, the former Manchester United star was surrounded by his loving family, marking the special occasion with laughter and joy.\n\nBut as the family sat down to enjoy their birthday lunch, there was one missing face - that of Brooklyn, the eldest Beckham son. As the seconds ticked by, the family began to worry, their hearts heavy with worry and longing.\n\nBut just as they were about to give up hope, Brooklyn walked through the door, a smile on his face and a spring in his step. His father, the former Real Madrid star, couldn't believe his eyes as he teared up with emotion. The two men, who had been apart for far too long, embraced tightly, as if they had never been apart.\n\nVictoria Beckham captured the emotional moment on camera and posted it to Instagram, where it has since been viewed by millions. The video is a testament to the power of family and the strength of love, a reminder that no distance can ever truly separate the heart.\n\nBrooklyn, 19, has been making a name for himself in the fashion industry, modeling in New York City and attending college. On his birthday, he posted a photo of himself at the new Nordstrom men's store in midtown, looking stylish and confident.\n\nThroughout the day, David Beckham posted updates on Instagram, showing off the heartfelt gifts his family had given him. Romeo, 15, wrote a card that simply said, \"You are the best dad in the world! I hope you have the best day!\" Cruz, 13, gave his dad a card with a giant gorilla on it, the words \"Dad, you the man\" spelled out in bold letters. Harper Seven, 6, gave her dad a key chain with the words \"Daddy's wine cellar. Love Harper! XOXO\" etched on it.\n\nAs the day wore on, Brooklyn posted a photo of his dad enjoying a glass of red wine, looking relaxed and happy. It was a simple moment, but one that spoke to the deep love and bond that exists between the Beckham family.\n\nOn this special day, we celebrate David Beckham and all that he has accomplished in his life. But more than anything, we celebrate the love and joy that he has brought into the world through his family. Happy birthday, David Beckham. You are loved and celebrated by so many.",

Disick and Kardashian, who share three children, were together for nine years before splitting in July 2015. Kardashian, 39, and Bendjima, 25, called it quits on Tuesday after almost two years together.\n\nA source close to Disick told E! News exclusively on Wednesday, \"Scott is very happy Kourtney cut it off with Younes. Although he is happy in his relationship with Sofia, he never liked Younes for Kourtney.\" Disick, 35, and Sofia Richie, 19, have been in a public relationship since September. It is his longest relationship since splitting from Kardashian three years ago.\n\nThe source continued, \"Scott and Kourtney are in a cordial place right now. Scott is always resistant to rock the boat with Kourtney. He truly will always care about her as wants her to be happy. Everything is always better for the kids' sake, when they are in a good place.\"\n\nKardashian and Bendjima, who started dating in late 2016, began their relationship after Kardashian ended her nine-year relationship with Disick. Bendjima is Kardashian's longest relationship since splitting from Disick.\n\nAnother source previously told E! News, \"In the beginning, Scott was making fun of Kourtney for dating someone so young and saying it would never last. Once he got with Sofia, he couldn't say anything about Younes. It gave him a lot of perspective and understanding that age is just a number. It was hard for him to see Kourtney dating and he was looking for any reason to not like Younes. But since being with Sofia, he has moved on. Scott cares a lot less than he used to. Of course, Kourtney has a very special place in his heart and always will. He wants Kourtney to be happy.\"",

According to April Masini, a relationship expert and online advice forum host, the couple's pattern of breaking up and getting back together is a bad behavioral pattern that can become a source of strain in their daily lives. \"Drama replaces problem solving and breakups become a very disruptive part of the relationship dynamic,\" Masini said.\n\nSusan Winter, another relationship expert and best-selling author, added that reuniting with an ex is typically not worthwhile unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted. \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" Winter said. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change.

Love can't conquer everything.\"\n\nDespite these experts' advice, it's possible that Evans and Slate may be following the same line of thinking that has led to their previous breakups. \"They're a great odd couple, and Hollywood loves an odd couple romance,\" Masini said. \"And they're not insusceptible to what fans love to see, which makes their issues even tougher.\"\n\nThe good news is that breakups can often lead to positive change. \"A breakup can be an enormous motivator to improve ourselves,\" Winter said. \"The clients that come to me and tell me they've lost somebody they love are so incredibly motivated to correct and change things about themselves and their personality.\"\n\nWhether Evans and Slate will heed this advice remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: getting back together with an ex is rarely the solution to relationship problems.",

Real-life reporting usually requires substantiation, which is absent here.\n\n4. **Entertainment Value**: The nature of the conflict (rumors, confrontations among housewives) aligns with the dramatic and sensationalized content commonly found in reality TV, suggesting it is crafted for entertainment purposes rather than reflecting actual events.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis that the message fits the profile of scripted reality television content, I assess that the likelihood of this message being real is low.

It encourages readers to embrace this change and emphasizes the beauty and uniqueness of these new styles.\n\nSeveral elements suggest that this message is more promotional than factual:\n1. **Language and Tone**: The message uses persuasive language (\"Say goodbye,\" \"embrace the beauty,\" \"break free\") typical of marketing or promotional materials rather than neutral, factual reporting.\n   \n2. **Absence of Objective Evidence**: There are no specific data points, statistics, or expert opinions cited to support the claim that white wedding gowns are \"a thing of the past\" or that colorful dresses are now dominant.\n\n3. **Subjectivity**: The message appeals to emotions and personal preferences (\"embrace the endless possibilities of color and style\"), which are subjective rather than objective criteria.\n\n4. **Generalization**: The statement presents a sweeping generalization about a cultural shift in bridal fashion without acknowledging potential regional, cultural, or demographic variations.\n\nConsidering these points, the message appears to be advocating for a particular perspective rather than objectively reporting a verifiable change in bridal fashion trends.

Many brides are opting for colors beyond white to express personal style and uniqueness.\n\n2. **Fashion Trends**: Fashion is known for evolving and challenging norms. Bridal fashion, like all aspects of fashion, reflects changing tastes and attitudes in society.\n\n3. **Consumer Behavior**: The message appeals to the growing consumer desire for customization and personal expression in weddings, which aligns with broader trends in consumer behavior.\n\n4. **Industry Innovation**: The bridal industry has shown adaptation to new trends and consumer demands, with designers and retailers offering more diverse options in bridal wear.\n\nConsidering these points, the message's assertion that traditional white wedding gowns are becoming less dominant and that unconventional colors are gaining popularity appears to align with current trends and cultural shifts. Therefore, it is more likely to be a real message reflecting ongoing changes in bridal fashion. \n\n**Verdict: 1**\n\nThus, I predict the veracity of the message as 1, indicating it is more likely a real message reflecting current trends in bridal fashion.",

From the dress that divided the world to the \"hot felon\" who became a global sensation, these are the moments that broke the internet in a way that no other could.\n\nThe dress that divided the world\n\nOn February 26, 2015, a tweet featuring a close-up photo of a dress went viral, sparking a heated debate about its color. The dress was actually a blue and black bandage dress from British retailer Roman Originals, but people saw it as gold and white or blue and black. The debate raged on for days, with 7.6 million tweets and a surge in traffic to Roman Originals' site. The retailer sold out of the original black and gold dress in 34 minutes and eventually sold a white and gold version in support of British charity Comic Relief.\n\nApril the Giraffe's birth\n\nIn the spring of 2017, all eyes were on April, a pregnant giraffe at Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York. The live-streaming camera set up in April's habitat captivated viewers as she gave birth to calf Tajiri on April 15, 2017. The live stream garnered more than 232 million live views on YouTube over a seven-week period.\n\nThe \"yanny\" or \"laurel\" debate\n\nIn May 2018, a bizarre recording of the word \"laurel\" split the internet in two. While some heard the word \"laurel,\" others clearly heard \"yanny,\" and nobody could agree on who was right. The audio clip was from an online dictionary entry, and the differing interpretations of the clip all had to do with how the brain interprets sound frequencies.\n\nJeremy Meeks, the \"hot felon\"\n\nIn June 2014, the Stockton Police Department released a mugshot of Jeremy Meeks, a 30-year-old inmate arrested on a weapons charge. Meeks' chiseled jaw and piercing eyes quickly made him a global sensation, and he was dubbed the \"hot felon.\" Meeks signed to a modeling agency and has since worked around the world.\n\nBeyonc√©'s pregnancy announcement\n\nWhen Beyonc√© makes an announcement, the world stops to listen, and her early morning pregnancy announcement was no different. Pregnant with twins, Queen Beyonc√© posted a photo to Instagram in the wee hours of February 1, 2017, announcing that the Carter-Knowles family was \"blessed two times over\" and would be growing their family by two. The announcement post earned more than 11 million likes, making it one of the most-liked Instagram posts of all time.\n\nTrump's \"covfefe\" tweet\n\nOn May 31, 2017, President Trump tweeted, \"Despite the constant negative press covfefe.\" A screenshot of the now-deleted tweet shows Trump's use of \"covfefe\" in an apparent typo. The word became a catchphrase of sorts that spawned T-shirts, hashtags, and even a license plate. The baffling term even lent its name to a legislative proposal from U.S. Rep Mike Quigley. If enacted, the COVFEFE Act (Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act) would have required the National Archives to keep records of the president's tweets.\n\nKim Kardashian's Paper magazine cover\n\nIn 2017, Kim Kardashian's bare-all cover of Paper magazine brought the phrase \"break the internet\" into the public lexicon. The magazine unveiled two covers shot by Jean-Paul Goude that feature the reality star, including one where she bares all. In the second photo, a recreation Goude's \"Champagne Incident\" photograph from the 1960s, Kardashian is popping open a bottle of champagne that has fountained over her head and into a glass balanced on her derriere.\n\nThe ALS Ice Bucket Challenge\n\nIn 2014, the ALS Association's Ice Bucket Challenge swept the web, d",

With estimated net worths of over $100 million, it's hard to imagine the amount of hard work and dedication that has gone into his success.\n\nBut what exactly does Wade make his money from? The answer is simple: basketball and massive paychecks. Since joining the NBA in 2003-2004, Wade has made over $136 million playing the game he loves. His current contract pays him $15 million this season, with another $16.1 million due next season if he opts-in to his player option.\n\nBut Wade's success doesn't stop there. Along with LeBron James, Wade has mastered the art of taking short-term contracts to increase his flexibility and secure larger annual contracts. In 2014, he signed a two-year, $31.1 million contract with a player option, setting him up to be a free agent when the salary cap increases in 2016-2017. And when that time comes, Wade will be set to cash in on the biggest paydays of his career.\n\nHowever, even with all of his accomplishments, Wade was only the 21st highest-paid player in the NBA last year, according to ESPN. He made far less than players like Joe Johnson, Rudy Gay, and Brook Lopez. But that's not reason to feel bad for Wade, though. He's made tens of millions more in sponsorship deals, including a high-profile deal with a sports brand in China.\n\nOver the years, Wade has had sponsorship deals with Converse and Nike, but his biggest deal was with Chinese shoe company Li Ning. In 2012, he signed a 10-year deal with the company that few consumers know in the U.S., but which will pay him millions annually along with a reported $60 million stake in the company. It was a high-risk move for both Li Ning and Wade, and it's uncertain if it's paying off. Li Ning just reported its third straight year of losses, and its stock has gone almost nowhere since Wade signed the deal.\n\nOn top of Li Ning, Wade has had slightly less lucrative deals with Gatorade, Pepperidge Farm, Mission, and other brands. In total, Forbes estimates that he made $12 million in sponsorships last year.\n\nAdd it all up, and Dwyane Wade has made well over $200 million in his career. But after paying agents, managers, and living expenses, his net worth is likely significantly less than that. Estimates of his net worth are between $95 million and $115 million, and he has millions more coming in future years.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, Dwyane Wade has built a huge net worth and he'll likely add to it in years to come. And for those who have followed his career, it's clear that his success is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and willingness to take risks.",

Upon arrival, I discovered that the parlor floor, despite the unseasonable heat outside, was warmed by a roaring fire. As I waited, I realized that I was sitting in Harvey Weinstein's living room. He had purchased the six-story house in 2006, before marrying Chapman, and she had since transformed it with her style. The black floors and white rugs, chinoiserie, gilt, and glass, hydrangeas in a vase, and a Jo Malone candle completed the ambiance.\n\nA few weeks earlier, I had met Chapman at the Marchesa fashion company atelier, where she co-owns the business with Keren Craig. She appeared nervous and uncomfortable, mentioning that she had not been out in public for five months since similar accusations against her husband were made public. Today, she was more relaxed, though there was a sense of gallows humor. When I mentioned the warm weather, she quipped, \"Think of all the poor plants that are going to spring out and then die.\"\n\nWe moved downstairs to the ground floor, which was a large, open space with modern furniture and surprising art. There was a spacious kitchen that overlooked the backyard, and a TV room where Chapman's son Dash was sitting on a sectional encircled by some kind of electronic device. At 42, Chapman looked younger than in photographs, perhaps because she was more goofy than I had imagined. Although she retained her British accent, she was more laid-back than I had expected.\n\nOur meeting took place in Chapman's soon-to-be-ex-townhouse that had recently been sold by her soon-to-be-ex-husband. It was meant to be the first time she publicly addressed what happened with her husband. However, the night before our meeting, she called me late and sounded worried, apologetic, and unsure of whether she was ready to address difficult questions. I reassured her that we could discuss topics unrelated to her marriage to Weinstein. During our meeting, we primarily discussed her life before her marriage to Weinstein and her fashion company Marchesa.",

It also mentions plans to visit Sydney annually, referencing his tour schedule and relationship dynamics.\n\n2. **Facts Check**:\n   - The Weeknd has indeed performed in Sydney, Australia, as part of his international tours, making this aspect plausible.\n   - His past relationship with Selena Gomez and subsequent breakup are public knowledge.\n   - Speculation about his personal life, including his relationships and tour schedules, is common in celebrity news.\n\n3. **Sources and Reporting Style**:\n   - The message seems to blend factual elements with speculative language (\"sparking speculation,\" \"reportedly stated,\" \"has been reunited\"), which is typical of entertainment news coverage.\n   - Specific details such as frequent tour schedules and the current status of his relationships with Selena Gomez and Bella Hadid align with known public information.\n\n4. **Commonsense Assessment**:\n   - Considering the context of celebrity news and the coherence of the narrative presented (tour schedules affecting relationships, current status with exes), the message aligns with what one might expect in entertainment reporting.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears more likely to be a real representation of current events in the entertainment industry rather than fabricated or false information.

An added layer of sentiment came from being able to record the song in a Nashville studio, the city Taylor moved at age 14 to pursue country music.\" Spin has speculated on the reasons behind the edit, as well as Swift's alteration of the date in the song's opening line, which she changes from Sept. 21 to Sept. 28.\n\nSwift's comments on the other track remained unchanged in the press release: \"Delicate' is a song about the vulnerability that immediately surfaces in all of us the minute we meet someone we want to like us,\" it reads. \"We think about everything they might've heard about us, every reason they wouldn‚Äôt want us. Every step forward toward that other person scares us, but it thrills us too. 'Delicate' is about the balancing act of the rush and the fear and hoping it's really worth it to take that chance.\"\n\nThis isn't Swift's first foray into Spotify exclusives, as she released a \"Delicate\" vertical video in recent weeks. In 2014, Swift harshly criticized the service and removed her music from all streaming platforms over what she said were unfair royalty payments. She relented with Apple a few months later, and ultimately returned all of her albums to the major services in June of last year.

So I said, 'I'll catch you at that party.' And that was it. I went to the party, and all of a sudden blogs were reporting that I turned him down, which would never happen.\n\nThankfully, that didn't stop me from appearing in Drake's \"Nice for What\" video alongside other famous women, which I called a \"dream come true.\"\n\nAs for my critically-acclaimed HBO series Insecure, I told Colbert that my mom stopped watching after a few racy scenes in season 2.

According to the Associated Press, Moore made the bold claim, \"I want Montana to be known as a decent state.\"\n\nDespite Moore's bizarre stance, the U.S. sales for yoga clothes have increased an astounding 45 percent year over year, while participation in yoga sports has only increased by a measly 4.5 percent. This means that more and more women are embracing athleisure wear as their go-to uniform, and for good reason - yoga pants are versatile, seasonless, and most importantly, comfortable.\n\nBut just because yoga pants are comfortable, doesn't mean they should be worn anywhere and everywhere. Here are some tips on how to wear yoga pants around town without getting the side-eye:\n\nDO: Learn from Lululemon's sheer pants recall. Make sure you select a pair that is truly opaque. Test them out in broad daylight or under bright lights.\n\nDON'T: Wear them to work. Ever. \"Dress Pant Yoga Pants\" is an oxymoron.\n\nDO: Invest in the correct size. It sounds like a no-brainer, but often women will purchase a size down to get a tighter fit or a longer shelf life since yoga pants stretch out. In reality, all you end up with is \"camel toe.\" Avoid at all costs.\n\nDON'T: Show your panty lines. If thongs aren't your thing, Commando and Zobha make great full-coverage bikini bottoms that are undetectable.\n\nDO: Layer up! Throwing on a leather jacket or a dark trench over your yoga pants and T-shirt will instantly dress up your look when you're running from bikram to brunch.\n\nDON'T: Keep wearing your favorite pair after the expiration date. Unlike jeans, yoga pants don't age well. Toss them when they're overly faded, stretched or ripped.\n\nDO: Accessorize! Nothing pulls together athleisure wear like a statement handbag and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nDON'T: Try to pull off your zaniest tie-dye yoga pants outside your ashtanga class. Stock up on neutral colors ‚Äî navy, black, charcoal ‚Äî that will go with anything.\n\nDO: Consider your tight-fitting yoga pants a thicker alternative to leggings in the wintertime. On the weekends, pair with knee-high boots and an oversized sweater, or wear them underneath a dress. No one will know the difference.\n\nTo shop the best yoga pants on the market, click on the slideshow below.",

The posh lives of millennial women are on full display as Katie Cazorla struggles to maintain her new caf√©, Hi SocieTea, which has faced unexpected setbacks. Meanwhile, Shiva Safai plays the matchmaker for her younger brother, Shanin, in a bid to find him a suitable partner.\n\nBusiness owner Katie Cazorla was overjoyed to open her caf√©, Hi SocieTea, but disaster struck on the day of the grand opening. A leak in the kitchen had her freaking out about the upcoming health inspection and the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars and two years of her life. Despite her fears, Katie remains committed to both her business and human connections, as she shares that getting married is a \"really really big deal\" for her husband, Walter.\n\nAs Katie faces setbacks with her caf√©, Veronika Obeng opens up about her husband's affair with Katie. Veronika reveals that she was \"pregnant the whole time it was happening\" and had to carry the burden of the heartache and betrayal.\n\nMeanwhile, Shiva Safai has been determined to find her younger brother a suitable partner, and has even joined forces with Mohamed Hadid to scour the streets of Beverly Hills for the perfect girl. The task was to find \"one girl each,\" and the two set their sights on finding the perfect match for their respective siblings.\n\nIn the end, Shiva wins the bet, as Shanin was most drawn to her pick. Shiva was over the moon with her victory and went on to share that she doesn't care if Shanin is already in a relationship or even if he has a wife, as long as she \"won this bet.\" However, little did she know that Shanin was already in a relationship with another girl at the time.\n\nThis heart-wrenching episode of the Second Wives Club serves as a reminder that love and relationships can be complicated, and that betrayal and heartache can lurk around every corner. Despite the challenges, these women remain committed to their businesses and to each other, and their resilience and strength is truly inspiring.",

They claimed that Weinstein's alleged unwanted sexual advances occurred on a single day and consisted of asking her to give him a massage, asking her to help him pick out clothes, and asking her to watch him shower.\n\nIn response to the motion to dismiss, Judd's attorney Theodore Boutrous Jr. said that \"Mr. Weinstein's arguments seeking to escape the consequences of his despicable misconduct are not only baseless, they are offensive.\"\n\nJudd, 50, was among the first women to go public with allegations against Weinstein, who faces criminal sexual assault charges in New York and has been named in several other sexual harassment lawsuits.",

Jason Phillips, CEO of the Friant Water Authority, noted that recent rainfall had not solved the long-standing problem of nearly a decade of drought.

Harris is seeking to be more like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has worked for two decades to aid the agricultural industry. However, Harris' predecessor, former Sen. Barbara Boxer, was more aligned with environmental groups, which has led to a negative view of her in the Central Valley.\n\nSome participants lobbied Harris for her support of dams that have long been under consideration by federal and state officials, particularly the Temperance Flat Dam, which would be constructed on the San Joaquin River. Harris offered no assurances on the topic, and speaking to reporters after the meeting, she said she would advocate for farmers during the crafting of a new farm bill and other measures before the Senate.\n\nWilliam Bourdeau, executive vice president of the influential Harris Farms, wished that Harris' urban supporters had a \"better understanding\" of the risks and challenges of farming.

I was not consulted or notified about Ms. Thurman driving a car on camera that day.‚Äù\n\nAdams, an experienced coordinator with a specialization in automotive work, added that if he had been involved, he would have insisted on using a professional driver and ensuring the car was road-worthy and safe. He did not specify whether he believed the stunt department was intentionally kept at bay to facilitate an actor performing dangerous driving maneuvers.\n\nThurman herself has described the 1973 Karmann Ghia as a \"death box\" and claimed that the incident was the result of a cover-up by production executives. The stunt coordinator's new statement underscores Thurman's account of the incident and highlights the dangers of allowing actors to perform dangerous driving stunts on set.\n\nMany people share safety duties on set, including producers, directors, and the stunt coordinator. However, in this case, Adams admits that he did not have the opportunity to intervene when changes to the shoot were made, leaving the safety of the cast and crew at risk.\n\n‚ÄúOn any set, my number one priority is the safety of the cast and crew,‚Äù Adams said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, I did not have that opportunity in this case.‚Äù\n\nThis new revelation adds to the growing controversy surrounding the incident and raises serious questions about the safety protocols in place on set.

According to an insider, the couple decided to take a break primarily due to Selena's mother's disapproval of Justin. While Justin's family is said to love Selena, Selena's family has placed her in a conflicting position as they still do not trust Justin. Selena has attempted to convince her family that Justin has changed, but they are not yet willing to accept him.\n\nThe relationship between Gomez, 25, and her mother, Mandy Teefy, has been strained since Gomez started seeing Bieber again after undergoing a kidney transplant and recovering from complications last summer. Gomez split from The Weeknd in October 2017 after just 10 months of dating. Although Bieber and Gomez went public with their reunion shortly after, Gomez did not bring Bieber to celebrate Thanksgiving with her family. A source told Us Weekly at the time that Gomez did not believe her mother, in particular, would approve of her relationship with Bieber.\n\nThe insider also added that Gomez's relationship with Bieber has had a significant impact on her relationship with her mother. Gomez considers her mother to be her rock and the two are very close, but Gomez's health complications have made it difficult for her mother to accept her relationship with Bieber. Justin Bieber's relationship with Selena Gomez is probably his most famous romance, but it certainly isn't his only one.\n\nThe couple was last seen leaving church separately on March 8 after vacationing in Jamaica.

Feratovic's Twitter account has since been deleted, but not before he made a series of tweets that raised eyebrows.\n\nFeratovic has a criminal trespassing arrest at the same apartment building from May of 2016, adding to his long list of legal troubles.

Kidman's career in Australia would continue for a few more years, as she worked in both movies and TV.\n\nBut it was her international breakout role in 1989's Dead Calm that would change the course of her life. She portrayed the wife of a naval officer in the thrilling Australian thriller, and it was this movie that caught the attention of audiences worldwide and launched her into American cinema.\n\nHer arrival to the American movie industry was in the film Days of Thunder in 1990, where she met Tom Cruise, who would become her husband.

They appeared together at the Academy Awards in 1991, where Kidman earned her first-ever Golden Globe nomination for her role in the film Billy Bathgate.\n\nHowever, their marriage was not meant to last. In February 2001, the couple announced their separation, and quickly after, they filed for divorce. It was a tough year for Kidman, but it was also a professional highlight, as her performance in the film Moulin Rouge earned her her first Oscar nomination and Golden Globe award, for best actress in a motion picture - musical or comedy.\n\nAfter her divorce from Cruise, Kidman found love again with the musician Lenny Kravitz, but their relationship was brief and intense. They were even engaged, but Kidman revealed in 2017 that they had called things off in 2004. Kidman spoke about a secret fianc√© to Vanity Fair in 2007, saying \"It just wasn't right. I wasn't ready. We weren't ready.\"\n\nThings are all good between Kidman and Kravitz now.

        "content": "The biggest fashion faux pas for a wedding guest would be to upstage the bride. With all the attention and speculation surrounding Kate Middleton's gown for her upcoming royal wedding, it would be nearly impossible to do. However, there are other unwritten rules that guests should consider. Don't wear white, anything too revealing, or a hat that is too wide or tall to block the view of the person behind you. You can wear tasteful black, and be sure to cover your arms.\n\n\"This is not a place to make a fashion statement for yourself,\" said Sally Kilbridge, deputy editor of Brides magazine. She goes on to list more don'ts, including no miniskirts, plunging necklines, and novelty socks, which have become a surprising trend among guests at American weddings. The attire worn to a British royal wedding is appropriate daytime wedding attire kicked up many notches, Kilbridge said. Everyone's outfit should be chic, elegant, and suit the very formal, traditional occasion while not letting glitzy, black-tie, eveningwear trappings creep in.\n\nDesigner Reem Acra thinks Westminster Abbey could be the place for cocktail frocks, especially for celebrities and fashion editors who have long found reason to wear them before noon. The fashion role model for older women should be well-cut, luxe-fabric skirt suits, while Middleton's younger friends could pull off slightly retro, Hitchcock-inspired sheaths or pencil skirts paired with nipped-waist jackets. George Kotsiopoulos, co-host of E!'s Fashion Police, expects a lot of hats, but hopes they'll be toned-down cloches or a pillbox with a veil.\n\nVivien Sheriff, a British milliner who has made several dozen custom headpieces for wedding guests, said many guests will follow the lead of Middleton's mother, Carole, who is a fan of substantial hats. The hats Sheriff has made feature some feathers and crystals, but they're not oversized. \"You can't show off too much. You don't want to overdo it, but there is a lot of expression in the headpieces.\" Sheriff added that people aren't going to want to hide their faces, so the brims won't cover them. \"This way, everyone can get good photos and you can greet other guests looking them in the eye.\"\n\nThere will be more black than one might expect, Sheriff said. She had more orders for black than she expected. \"I guess fashion has changed and a lot of young guests want to wear black.\" However, black is fine as long as it's not funereal, according to Brides' Kilbridge, although the Middleton family won't wear it. Prince Charles' wife, Camilla, won't wear it either, Kilbridge predicted. Camilla will likely pluck something she already had in her closet, Kilbridge said, probably something not unlike the tailored dress and lovely coat she wore to her own wedding.\n\nMost of the male guests will likely don a navy or gray morning suit, which is basically the daytime equivalent of a tuxedo including a vest or waistcoat. All of William's military friends will be in uniform, Kilbridge said. A guest with a well-known personal style has a little more flexibility, said Kilbridge. It would be perfectly acceptable for Elton John, for example, to wear a flashy, embroidered vest under his jacket. Fashion fans will be eager to see David and Victoria Beckham, and Kilbridge thinks they won't disappoint, although she wonders how Victoria Beckham will dress her baby bump. \"They've had some crazy fashion moments, but this won't be one of them. She'll probably look fantastic. They want to create the impression that she belongs there. I think most people will be striving to look like they belong.\" That might have singer Joss Stone, who is famously barefoot almost everywhere she goes, digging to the bottom of her closet looking for a pair of shoes.",

One user even joked about the possibility of Instagram being without editing apps, leaving Khlo√© to respond with a heartfelt message about the importance of kindness and positivity.\n\n\"would you keep IG if all photo editing apps were gone forever??? Lol,\" the user wrote. \"Our world is toxic enough as it is. It's sad people care to criticize something like an editing app. Let it go babes. Say something nice or just let it go. How does this serve you love?\"\n\nKhlo√©'s response was simple and powerful: \"sometimes I wonder why people comment if it adds no value to ones life? Maybe I'm just different...but I don't care to be negative or passive aggressive. Our world is toxic enough as it is. It's sad people care to criticize something like an editing app. Let it go babes. Say something nice or just let it go. How does this serve you love?\"\n\nAnother user decided to take it upon themselves to remind Khlo√© of her brother, Rob, as if that's something she would forget. \"It's a shame Rob Kardashian is a member of the family and he is NEVER mentioned!!!\" the comment read.\n\nBut Khlo√© was not going to let that one go. \"my brother is my entire world! He is definitely a king üëë it is a shame that can respect us for respecting his privacy. You should not comment if you truly aren't informed about our family,\" she replied.\n\nKhlo√©'s message is clear: trolls will not come for her without facing the consequences. She will stand up for her loved ones and defend her own worth, no matter what.\n\nIt's important to remember that Khlo√© is more than just a reality TV star. She is a mother, a daughter, and a woman who deserves to be treated with kindness and respect.

The board, who reviewed Weinstein's membership during an emergency meeting, released a statement saying it \"voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority to immediately expel him from the Academy.\"\n\nThe statement from the Academy read, \"We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over. What‚Äôs at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society. The Board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.\"\n\nMia Farrow, whose son Ronan recently published a New Yorker investigation with rape and sexual assault allegations against Weinstein's, took to Twitter to express her support of the board's decision. She wrote, \"I'm proud of the Academy for voting to expel Harvey Weinstein. Hopelessly grateful that we are witnessing the end of an awful era.\"\n\nRon Perlman also expressed his pride in the Academy's decision to expel Weinstein, tweeting, \"I'm proud of their decision to expel Harvey Weinstein.

Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual assault by numerous actresses, becomes the second person ever to be kicked out of the Academy, after Godfather actor Carmine Caridi, who was removed in 2004 for illegally sharing Oscar screeners.\n\nThe Weinstein Company, which he helped to found, has fired him, and his wife, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Weinstein's brother Bob spoke of his \"waking nightmare\" and expressed his desire for his brother to receive \"the justice he deserves.\"\n\nThe fallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal continues more than a week after an explosive New York Times investigation detailed decades of sexual harassment accusations against Weinstein.

The women stood together in solidarity, calling for greater representation and equal opportunities in the film industry.\n\nIn a joint statement, Blanchett and French director Agnes Varda emphasized the need for transparency and parity in executive bodies and work environments. They called for governments to enforce equal pay laws and for workplaces to be diverse and equitable. The women also acknowledged the efforts of those standing for change and called for the industry's stairways to be accessible to all.\n\nThe protest was part of the 5050x2020 movement, which seeks to achieve gender parity across all aspects of the film industry by the year 2020. The number 82 was selected to match the number of films directed by women in the festival's history, with only 4.3% of competition films in the past 71 years being directed by women.\n\nOther notable women involved in the protest included Salma Hayek, Marion Cotillard, director Patty Jenkins, and Haifaa al-Mansour. The protest was organized by French group Le Deuxieme Regard and the 5050x2020 collective, in collaboration with the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe protest comes in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #MeToo and Time's Up movements, which have sparked a renewed demand for change in the film industry. The movement also echoes broader calls for gender equality and diversity in the workplace.\n\nWhile progress has been made in recent years, with more women making the cut in competition, the statistics for women in Cannes are still dismal. Only one woman has won the Palme d'Or, and only one woman has been named Best Director. The festival has been criticized for its lack of diversity and inclusion, and for failing to provide a platform for women filmmakers.\n\nHowever, the rise of women in the film industry is undeniable, and the protest at Cannes highlights the need for continued efforts to promote gender equality and diversity in the industry. As the movement continues to gain momentum, it remains to be seen what concrete actions will be taken to address these issues and create a more inclusive and equitable film industry.",

The news surprised fans who had been speculating about the couple's potential divorce for months.\n\nAccording to a report by Radar Online, several factors contributed to the decision to end their marriage. One of these was Tatum's desire to have more children. Despite being the parents of a daughter, Everly, Tatum reportedly wanted a larger family. However, Dewan was not on board with this idea. A previous report by OK! Magazine suggested that Dewan wanted to return to acting and that caring for a newborn would interfere with her plans.\n\nAnother factor in the separation was reportedly the couple's differing views on family life. Although Tatum was earning enough money to support the family, he wanted Dewan to be at home with Everly so she would not be raised by nannies. However, Dewan reportedly grew tired of being a housewife while Tatum spent his time on movie sets.\n\nAdditionally, jealousy is said to have played a role in the separation. As Tatum's fame increased with films such as 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, and its sequels, he became a sex symbol in Hollywood, attracting numerous women. Sources claim that Dewan was uncomfortable with the way Tatum interacted with fans, including flirting with them in front of her.\n\nIn an official statement released via social media, Tatum and Dewan announced their separation and stated that they would not be making further comments on the matter.",

Hoss thinks that difference is a source of strength and that Petzold chooses women for his characters because it gives him some distance, making the relationship interesting and surprising.\n\nOverall, the relationship between directors and actors can be complex and ever-evolving, and it is important to understand the dynamics at play in order to appreciate the work that these creative professionals produce.",
