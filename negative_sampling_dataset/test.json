In a TikTok video that has gone viral, Frankel reveals that she had a negative experience with the actor years ago and believes he was \"put upon\" by the situation.\n\nFrankel, 51, opens up about her encounter with Hill on the set of Jay Leno's The Tonight Show, saying, \"He was a low-grade d**k to me. I felt like a loser and the nobody that I was.\" However, she quickly distances herself from the drama surrounding Hill and Brady and questions the timing of their explosive claims.\n\n\"I don’t know the whole story, I only read the snippets of headlines, but if you're in a relationship with someone for one year, are texts fair game?\" Frankel asks, adding that the notion of publicly sharing texts from exes is \"frightening.\"\n\nDespite her past negative experience with Hill, Frankel believes it's not okay to be \"emotionally harmful\" to your partner, something Brady has accused Hill of. Frankel's message is clear: Hill may have treated her poorly years ago, but that does not justify the explosive allegations that have rocked the actor's reputation.\n\nFrankel's support for Hill comes as a surprise to many, given her history of speaking out against emotional abuse. However, the reality star is known for always speaking her mind and standing up for what she believes is right, even if it goes against popular opinion.\n\nAs the drama surrounding Hill and Brady continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the world is watching closely and waiting for Frankel's next move.

Here's what we know so far about how the wedding will be a total departure from the 2011 ceremony between Prince William and Kate Middleton.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kensington Palace made the announcement that the wedding will take place in May 2018 at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, with the Queen giving her approval for the venue. The royal family will foot the bill for the wedding, and Windsor Castle, where the Queen calls home for part of every year, is located about 20 miles west of London. \"Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,\" Kensington Palace said in a statement. Harry himself was christened there in 1984, so by the rules of the Church of England, he can be married there.\n\nBut what really sets Harry and Meghan's wedding apart from any other royal affair? For starters, it won't be the first time a recent royal has married at St. George's. According to NBC News, Harry's uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999, and his cousin, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at the chapel in 2008. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles had a televised religious blessing there after they had a civil wedding ceremony nearby in 2005.\n\nSt. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle is a much smaller space than Westminster Abbey, holding around 800 people compared to the Abbey's whopping 2,000. Harry and Meghan plan on making the ceremony a reflection of their personalities and they're working on a way to involve the public in some way, their spokesman revealed. The couple wants the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family, but they also want the public to feel part of the celebrations.\n\n“It will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the character of the bride and groom,?their spokesman told journalists. “The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family. They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved.?Get ready for the most talked-about royal wedding of the century!",

Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air.\n\nBass and Waddell remain one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise and they now have their first child on the way. When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going.\n\n\"We were sort of in that wedding glow,\" Bass explains. \"It felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.\"\n\nThe morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return.\n\nIn the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set - something Harrison will discuss with the cast, also on Tuesday's episode.\n\nBass and Waddell say they are ready to pass the torch to another couple this season. \"There's going to be another couple this season that takes our place,\" says Bass. \"You can’t let the haters affect your relationship. There’s no way it doesn’t affect you, but you have to work through that together. It’s crazy how one person’s tweet affects you.\"\n\nLooking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show - and potentially the series - would ever resume. \"I felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,\" he now says. \"I trust everyone that’s a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back.\"\n\nAnd Waddell adds, \"We’re so excited to watch the season. The show has such a dear place in our hearts.\"",

While it is plausible for someone to use positive affirmations and believe in the power of a positive attitude for maintaining a youthful appearance, the fact that she has embroidered the phrase onto silk pillowcases seems somewhat embellished.

While Kaling has kept the identity of the baby's father private and her romantic relationship status unclear, this does not affect the veracity of the overall message.

However, his name has been dragged into the midst of a painful and heartbreaking situation involving allegations of sexual abuse made by his daughter, Dylan Farrow.\n\nIn an interview with Argentinian news program Periodismo Para Todos, Allen dismissed the allegations as false and defended himself, stating that he has been \"thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue.\" He added that it is \"a terrible thing to accuse a person of\" and that he has a \"family and his own children.\"\n\nThe resurfaced allegations against Harvey Weinstein and other Hollywood figures have sparked a conversation about sexual misconduct and the need for justice. Allen expressed his support for the #MeToo movement, saying that \"if there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things.\"\n\nHowever, the 82-year-old filmmaker is frustrated that his name has been equated with those accused of misconduct. He believes he should be \"the poster boy for the #MeToo movement,\" as he has worked in movies for 50 years and has never been accused of impropriety by any of the hundreds of actresses he has worked with.\n\nAllen's son Moses Farrow defended him in a blogpost, accusing his sister's story of being a \"discredited allegation\" and accusing his mother, Mia Farrow, of \"brainwashing\" and abusive behavior. In response, Dylan Farrow called his words \"beyond hurtful.\" Mia Farrow has previously stated that Moses Farrow has cut off his entire family, including his ex-wife, who was pregnant when he left, and that he made up the allegations to please Woody.\n\nAllen's next film, A Rainy Day in New York, faces an uncertain future after stars Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez, and Rebecca Hall donated their salaries to various charities.

        "content": "\"SHOCKER: TV Powerhouse Shonda Rhimes Ditches Disney for Netflix, Ending 15 Years of ABC Stardom!\"\n\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves throughout the entertainment industry, Shonda Rhimes, the creative mastermind behind hit TV shows such as \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"How to Get Away with Murder,\" has announced that she is leaving ABC Studios to join the ranks of Netflix.\n\nThis decision is a major blow to Disney, Rhimes' home for the past 15 years, and to broadcast TV in general. Rhimes has been one of the most reliable hitmakers in prime time in the past dozen years, and her departure will leave a huge void in the industry.\n\nAccording to sources close to Rhimes, the showrunner is ready to move on to a new chapter of her career, one that will give her and her Shondaland factory far more room to maneuver from a creative perspective.\n\nHowever, broadcast TV is still the biggest platform in the traditional TV universe, but it has become increasingly less attractive to creatives, especially those like Rhimes who have nothing left to prove in the network TV arena.\n\nAs development for the 2018-19 season cranks into high gear, industry insiders are grousing about a general stasis when it comes to dealmaking and a lack of ambition in programming at a time when the array of material on competing outlets has never been more diverse.\n\nOn the flip side, network executives privately say they feel like they're under siege. Success for them is still defined by broad-based hits, but smaller rivals are forking over significantly more money and perks to draw high-wattage talent.\n\nABC's perspective on Rhimes' departure is complicated. While it's hard to watch her walk out the door, she's still doing a lot of day-to-day business with them and will be for the foreseeable future.\n\nRhimes has no less than five series in various stages of production, including \"Grey's,\" \"HTGAWM,\" the final season of \"Scandal,\" new midseason legal drama \"For the People,\" and the untitled \"Grey's Anatomy\" spinoff revolving around firefighters. And there's at least one Shondaland pilot in the hopper for the 2018-19 season.\n\nABC Studios has expanded its focus to producing shows for non-ABC outlets, including its Marvel series for Netflix and the Showtime comedy \"SMILF.\" However, the appeal of a heavy courtship from Netflix is easy to understand. No ratings, more creative control, subject matter that need not be mass appeal - for a showrunner who has worked at a prolific pace for 15 years, what's not to love?\n\nRhimes' deal is unlike any other talent pact that Netflix has made to date. The company will provide generous overhead for Shondaland and its roughly 30 employees. Rhimes herself will see hefty upfront payments for her work on various shows.\n\nEven more than the bottom-line concerns, the optics of Rhimes deciding to change lanes and channel her creative energy into Netflix productions is a hit to broadcast TV's image. The showrunner will keep one foot firmly planted in her legacy shows for the time being - but for the future, Rhimes has voted with her feet.",

Abraham, 26, documented her experience at the Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Center in Los Angeles on Saturday, August 26.\n\nAbraham posted a photo on Instagram showing her standing alongside a doctor in front of a lobby desk, wearing a pretty lace top with a black skirt. She captioned it, \"Loving my lady parts!\" with the hashtag #vaginalrejuvenation. Another photo showed the reality star lying on an examination table with a sheet over her legs while she underwent the procedure.\n\nIn a video Abraham uploaded, her doctor explained the process of vaginal rejuvenation, saying, \"What this does is distributes little wounds through radio frequency which kind of breaks up the collagen and forces it to restore during that healing process, so everything becomes tighter and you actually experience ... like you're 16 again!\"\n\nHowever, Abraham's followers quickly slammed the single mom for sharing the private procedure. Many expressed their disappointment and concern for her daughter, Sophia. One person wrote, \"My god...poor little Sophia. A mother who ‘loves?her body so much she altered every bit of it. Great example. I hope Sophia will grow into a strong and independent woman who does not need her ‘mother?to be around.\"\n\nAnother commented, \"Farrah why? I understand you’re a mom and need the procedure for personal reasons but why make it public? Have respect as a mother for your child and for others.\"\n\nA third follower simply asked, \"Aren’t you like 25? Why do you need this?\"\n\nAbraham has previously undergone plastic surgery to alter her nose and chin, and has breast implants. She also shared pics on Twitter in 2015 of an allergic reaction she had to lip implants. Abraham also met with a surgeon in 2016, in a segment shown on The Doctors, to look into getting a butt lift.\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly's YouTube Page.",

On Monday night, the Countess took to the stage for another round of her cabaret show, #CountessAndFriends, from Feinstein's/54 Below in New York City.\n\nDuring the Q&A session, a fan asked if de Lesseps would ever consider reconciling with Medley. The two, both 53, had an explosive argument on the show's tenth season, which began when de Lesseps questioned Medley's drinking habits during a vacation with their castmates in Cartagena, Colombia. Medley's response was to mock de Lesseps for her headline-making arrest and trip to rehab.\n\nFurther insults were exchanged at the season 10 reunion, where Medley claimed that de Lesseps only sought treatment to avoid jail time and that she had become \"confused between fame and infamy\" after her cabaret show took off. The hurtful words still linger for de Lesseps. \"What she said hurts still,\" she admitted. \"I'm just trying to process it and get over it right now. I'm not ready to take the Band-Aid off. I'm still scarred from it!\"\n\nDespite the ongoing pain, de Lesseps remains hopeful that she and Medley can reconcile. \"I do [want to make up with her]. I love Dorinda,\" she said. \"We've known each other for a long time. I'm sure we'll come to a good decision.\"\n\nJohn Lamparski/Getty\n\nDe Lesseps was equally uncompromising during her appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on September 5. She denied the claim that she was court-ordered to go to rehab and defended her attitude towards the success of her cabaret show. \"Yeah, I'm not taking advice, right now, from Dorinda,\" she said. \"Thank you for those two cents. But I will say, my cabaret, to me, is everything. I've found my calling in my life and if that makes them uncomfortable, that is too bad for them. That's all I can say. When I do my shows, I'm on stage and I'm doing my thing, so I don't let [the boozy environment] really affect me. I understand their concern and I appreciate it, but I'm good because I'm on stage doing what I love.\"\n\nThat same positivity was evident on Monday night as de Lesseps took to the stage and sang about finding her calling in life. She was supported in the crowd by Real Housewives of New York City costars Sonja Morgan and Teresa Giudice, who performed with her. The three women shared a heartfelt moment as they celebrated the joys of self-expression and the strength it takes to pursue one's dreams.\n\nAs de Lesseps prepares for more performances of #CountessAndFriends, she remains committed to healing from the pain caused by her falling out with Medley. \"I'm doing what I love,\" she told the crowd. \"I found my calling.\" The additional shows will be announced on her official website shortly.",

But for Langford, saying goodbye to her first major role was bittersweet.\n\n\"In all honesty, no. I think [showrunner] Brian’s [Yorkey] always had an idea about how many episodes that I would be in, but this season was interesting because unlike last season, it was completely new territory,\" Langford told Entertainment Weekly. \"We weren’t based on a book, and particularly for Hannah, it was something that was developed over the course of shooting, but I think that ultimately it was important to have her back for a second season and assist in continuing the dialogue from season 1 and following a lot of the other characters this season, particularly Clay.\"\n\nBut playing Hannah this season was a challenge for Langford. \"Season 1 was something that I could really sink my teeth into and pour myself into the character, whereas this season was challenging as an actor because I had to put a lot of faith and a lot of trust into the writers and the directors in making sure that what I was doing was right and their vision,\" she explained. \"I think what everyone learned over the course of shooting and developing her was that you don’t see the same Hannah this season, and that’s for a number of reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is that every time we see Hannah this season, it’s either through flashbacks or filtered through the eyes of someone else. Or it’s through the eyes of Clay as a presence. You only ever see her through the eyes of someone else.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Langford was proud of the work they did with Hannah's story. \"For me, we told Hannah’s story so fully in season 1,\" she said. \"And in a way, doing that scene in episode 13 [of season 1], I’ve so often referred to it as it was the hardest scene because it’s the scene where I had to let her go. I think coming back this season was challenging because it was playing her but not really her. The challenge was when you tell a character’s story so fully, and then you have to come back as a version of her that’s filtered through other people’s eyes; that required a lot of trust.\"\n\nLangford hopes that people will take away from Hannah's story that \"it doesn’t matter who she was or what she did, she didn’t deserve any of what happened to her.\" And as for her career, playing Hannah was just one of many highlights for Langford, who is also in Love, Simon and has another film, Spontaneous, coming soon. \"13 Reasons Why will always be a really special part of my life,\" she said. \"But I’m also really excited for what’s to come.\"",

These certifications not only enhance the instructor's credibility, but also instill confidence in clients.\n\nThe job outlook for fitness workers is expected to grow at a faster-than-average rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is due in part to the growing obesity epidemic and the aging population, which both contribute to a continued demand for fitness instructor services.

The median salary of a fitness instructor was $29,210 in May 2008.\n\nFitness centers often require instructors to have a college education in exercise, nutrition, or wellness. College majors may include exercise science, physical education, or kinesiology, which is the study of human motion. Instructors must also have training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), either through college or the Red Cross.\n\nCertification is an important aspect of becoming a fitness instructor. Instructors who are certified have demonstrated their knowledge and expertise in a particular exercise program. Many agencies offer certification programs for various exercise programs, such as Pilates or aerobics. American Fitness Professionals and Associates also offers several certification programs, including specialization in sports nutrition, children's fitness, and prenatal exercise.\n\nFitness instructors must possess certain personality traits to be successful.

However, the source suggests that Pasternak is essentially being paid to simply watch West stand around rather than motivate him to exercise.\n\nThe outlet quotes the source as saying that West's fitness studio is one of his favorites.

When Pasternak demonstrates an exercise on one machine, West nods in agreement, but then they move to another machine and repeat the same exercise.\n\nDespite Pasternak's efforts, the source claims that West is not committed to improving his fitness and does not put in the necessary effort. The rumor about West's laziness at the gym comes on the heels of reports that he is still recovering from his mental breakdown, which hospitalized him for eight days in November.\n\nSome fans have speculated that West's mental breakdown may be to blame for his lack of motivation at the gym. However, others believe that he simply struggles with staying focused and engaged in his workouts.\n\nOverall, it appears that Kanye West is not as committed to his fitness as he could be, despite working with a personal trainer and visiting a gym regularly. Whether his mental breakdown is a factor remains to be seen, but it is clear that he has a long way to go before he can say he has fully recovered from his experience.",

        "content": "In this retrospective album, the early hits of the young twins are revisited. The opening track, \"Your Heartless Void,\" features a four-track demo that the girls recorded before being signed to a major label. The song's honest and sincere lyrics about the emptiness of modern romance and the importance of avoiding a meaningless existence are accompanied by a haunting classical guitar performance from Ashley-Olsen, reminiscent of early minimalist works by Lou Reed.\n\nThe following two tracks, \"Stabbing and Punching\" and \"Toothless Rookie,\" showcase the twins' brief dalliance with the punk scene. Despite the repetitive power chords and simplistic bridge-solos, the lyrics maintain a level of depth and meaning previously reserved for bands like The Ramones or The Clash. \"Stabbing\" in particular stands out, with Mary-Kate's powerful ending of screaming, \"You can rip out my heart, but you'll never take my soul you filthy [expletive]!\"\n\nThe next five tracks on the album are considered the weakest, with their focus on ponies and their various attributes. While these tracks are amusing in a contextually humorous way, they do tend to drone on.\n\nThe final three tracks on the album are considered the highlights, and are what have solidified the twins' status as a musical powerhouse. The production levels are greatly improved upon with the addition of Nigel Goodrich, and the songs showcase the twins' diverse range and songwriting abilities. \"I Wanna Dance All Night\" is a club anthem about dancing at all-night raves and meeting men of wealth and power, while \"4 All My Posse\" showcases the twins' take on gangsta rap. The album concludes with a country song about a missing cat, featuring subtle sonic brilliance.\n\nOverall, this is a solid compilation that provides a retrospective look at the twins' musical journey and highlights their growth as artists.",

He and his brother, Marc, pleaded guilty to filing falsified tax returns on nearly $9 million, a crime that defrauded the government out of $550,000 to $1.5 million in tax revenue.\n\nSorrentino, a beloved star of the hit show \"Jersey Shore,\" was initially indicted with his brother in 2014 for tax offenses and conspiring to defraud the United States. But the Department of Justice added charges last year, and Sorrentino was sentenced to two years in prison for his role in the fraud.\n\nSorrentino's accountant, Gregg Mark, admitted to filing the fraudulent returns in December 2015 in a Newark, New Jersey, federal court. Mark has not yet been sentenced, but he faces the same charges of tax evasion and structuring funds to evade currency transaction reports that landed his brother in prison.\n\nThe government included charges of tax evasion and structuring funds to evade currency transaction reports in April of 2017. Sorrentino and his brother created businesses to exploit the reality star's celebrity status and did not pay the required income tax on the $8.9 million Sorrentino earned between 2010 and 2012.\n\nSorrentino failed to file a personal tax return in 2011, instead filing a false corporate return for Situation Nation Inc. and concealing his cash income. He made multiple cash deposits in amounts less than $10,000 into different bank accounts on the same day in order to evade bank reporting regulations, according to his 2017 indictment.\n\nThe entire cast of \"Jersey Shore\" went to Sorrentino's sentencing on Friday in a show of support. But even with the support of his former castmates, Sorrentino's future is uncertain.\n\nSorrentino skyrocketed into fame in 2009 after being cast in MTV's reality series \"Jersey Shore.\" The show featured a group of young men and women living a house in Seaside, New Jersey, while working at a local t-shirt printing business. Sorrentino and the rest of the cast engaged in excessive partying and binge drinking on the show.\n\n\"Jersey Shore\" went on for six seasons before its cancellation in 2012. The show was revived by MTV earlier this year as \"Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.\" Sorrentino returned to film the series despite his legal and personal issues.

In a statement that left no doubt about her priorities, she said, \"I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.\"\n\nTheir divorce was not just about the scandal that had engulfed them, but also about the dwindling fortunes of one and the sturdy fortune of the other. Prior to Weinstein's downfall, he was estimated to be worth between $240 and $300 million; Chapman, on the other hand, was worth only about $20 million thanks to her popular fashion label, Marchesa.\n\nNow, details of their prenuptial agreement have been revealed by TMZ, and they are as heart-wrenching as the rest of the details of their marriage. According to TMZ, Chapman stands to receive $400,000 annually for every year of marriage to Weinstein, a figure that would add up to a total of $11.75 million as of December of this year. In addition to that annual sum, she would reportedly receive a $250,000 bonus per year of marriage up until her sixth year, when that figure was reportedly bumped to $700,000.\n\nThere are several reasons why the couple has not yet filed for divorce, despite the fact that their marriage has hit the 10-year mark on December 15, their wedding anniversary. A Hollywood divorce lawyer who has represented high-profile clients explained to Vanity Fair's Julie Miller in 2016 that high-profile clients will work out all the niceties prior to filing, so as to avoid scrutiny.\n\nAs the couple continues to navigate their divorce, it is clear that their love and commitment to each other has been tested like never before.

Unlike the typical true crime documentaries that aired on CBS, Investigation Discovery, Lifetime, and Dr. Phil last year, this film offers no new puzzle pieces or insight into the crime.\n\nInstead, the film focuses on local actors in the Boulder community, who are featured in limited reenactments, and the popular theories about the case. Filmmakers spent 15 months meeting with Coloradans and seeking out their beliefs about the crime.\n\nDuring their auditions, many reveal a tie to the incident, with a voice teacher's students knowing JonBenét, a hopeful vying for the part of Patsy, revealing her parents met the Ramsey matriarch and patriarch \"several times,\" and another actor revealing he was \"effectively (his girlfriend's) alibi.\"\n\nThe amateur thespians recall details of JonBenét's death, though not everyone's speech is dripping with confidence or certainty. They talk about the ransom note, totaling almost three pages, which was addressed on CBS' docu-series The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey last September. Their comments are similar to ones that could be heard at a brunch with friends discussing the latest episode of the popular podcast My Favorite Murder.\n\nThe film's centerpiece is not a child's untimely and cryptic death, but the subsequent conversations and attitudes formed about a family that intrigues many but few actually know. With the media, some sensationalized reports, and a surplus of shows surrounding the 20th anniversary of the crime, this film raises questions about whether we are so desperate to make sense of the senseless act that we cling to theories even if it means persecuting innocent people.",

The photo features Eichner out to dinner with several of his Season 8 castmates, including Kathy Bates, Sarah Paulson, Joan Collins, Cheyenne Jackson, Billie Lourd, Leslie Grossman, and Adina Porter, but one other cast member remains shrouded in mystery. Eichner has dubbed the person \"a secret friend,\" and the image has been cleverly doctored to conceal their identity.\n\nFans are eagerly speculating about who this \"secret friend\" might be. Is it a beloved alum returning to the franchise? Or is it someone entirely new to the series? Ryan Murphy has teased that the new season will feature a Murder House and Coven crossover, which has only added to the excitement. Emma Roberts has already confirmed that she will be returning as Madison Montgomery, but Eichner's cryptic caption only fuels the fire. \"With (some of) this season’s @ahsfx cast at dinner a few weeks ago...and a secret friend...it’s gonna be a wild one! Can’t wait....\"\n\nFans are casting their minds wide open, conjuring up all sorts of possibilities. Could it be Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, or Dylan McDermott, all of whom have starred in previous seasons of American Horror Story? Or perhaps it's Lea Michele, Anjelica Huston, or Cher, who have never appeared on the show before? The possibilities are endless, and fans can't wait to find out.\n\nAs the countdown to American Horror Story Season 8 continues, one thing is certain: viewers are in for a treat. The series has always been known for its spine-tingling scares, and this season is shaping up to be no exception.

According to eyewitnesses, the two celebrities were standing together at a VIP bar at Serena Williams' wedding to Alexis Ohanian. They both ordered glasses of champagne to celebrate the occasion. Kim, 37, was wearing a long, black dress that accentuated her hourglass figure, while Beyonce, 36, was dressed in a long-sleeved green gown.\n\nThe feud between Kanye and Jay-Z began a year ago when Kanye stopped a concert in Sacramento, California, to criticize his supposed friends. In a video of the incident, which was posted to Twitter, Kanye can be heard saying, \"Beyoncé, I was hurt 'cause I heard that you said you wouldn't perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over 'Hotline Bling,'\" before adding, \"In my opinion ?now don't go trying to diss Beyonce ?she is great. Taylor Swift is great.\" This statement was seen as a diss towards Beyonce, who had won the Video of the Year award over Kanye.\n\nJay-Z responded to the feud on TIDAL's Rap Radar podcast, where he spoke openly about how Kanye's actions had hurt him. As a result of this feud, Kim and Kanye are no longer close to Jay-Z and Beyonce. This makes the lyrics from Taylor Swift's new Kanye diss track, \"But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately. If only you weren't so shady,\" from her song \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things,\" seem to make more sense.\n\nWhat do you think about Kim and Beyonce's encounter?

And in a battle that leaves the viewer breathless, Spielberg emerges victorious.\n\nIf you're a fan of the 2011 Ernest Cline best-seller, you may not use the term \"banality\" to describe the story, but you'd have to acknowledge \"familiarity\" as a suitable replacement. We're transported back to the dystopian world of 2045, where millions of people are trapped in the virtual reality world of the OASIS, created by the late tech genius played by Mark Rylance.\n\nThe story is a digitized version of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" with the sweetly mad inventor hidden clues to three keys within the OASIS, and whoever finds all three becoming the heir to a massive fortune. Much of the film's thrilling first hour explores the ever-changing environments and rules within the OASIS, with a heartfelt quest for a real connection at its core.\n\nAs Wade/Parzival, played by Tye Sheridan, navigates through the virtual worlds, he faces off against corporate evil and the sniveling face of adversity, portrayed by Ben Mendelsohn. While the visual referencing is happily relentless, the film runs a bit long, with 140 minutes feeling overgenerous for the amount and quality of the narrative at hand.\n\nIn the later stages of the story, the routine complications and challenges posed by the Mendelsohn character and his aide, played by Hannah John-Kamen, bring the story to a close. But Spielberg's control of pacing, rhythm, action dynamics, and tone keeps the story from getting lost in the nostalgia-filled fly-by jokes and references.\n\nIn the end, Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\" stands as a testament to his mastery of storytelling and direction. It's a film that not only captures the hearts of its viewers but also challenges them to think about the future of virtual reality and the impact it will have on our lives.",

The act of kicking a leading candidate off the ballot has finally registered as inconsistent with \"defending our democracy.\"\n\nIn a sane world, the US Supreme Court would not only strike down the Colorado ruling but would issue a career-ending rebuke to the state justices who failed to understand the basic principle of due process: innocent until proven guilty. To brand someone a criminal, there must be a record of indictment and conviction for a particular crime, and that certainly does not apply to Mr. Trump.\n\nAs the nation prepares to celebrate Christmas, events have merged explosively to shape the fate of the nation. The Republican-majority Congress should have months ago convened new hearings about the Jan 6/21 Capitol riot to undo the manifold frauds instigated by the previous Democrat-majority committee.\n\nThe Substack blogger El Gato Malo has offered a tantalizing theory that a SCOTUS ruling on the 14th Amendment clauses that were applied to the presidency in the Colorado case could enable Special Counsel Jack Smith to slip in a superseding indictment with new charges against Mr. Trump, setting up a fortified argument for states to remove Mr. Trump from any ballot.\n\nThe courtroom win by Brandon Straka, who launched the \"Walk Away\" movement to persuade gays to leave the Democratic Party, highlights the absurdity of lawfare warriors and their useful idiots. The Jan 6/21 hearings on the Biden family's international bribery operations will shed some light on why we suffer a president and a party bent on destroying our country.\n\nAs we turn the corner into a fateful 2024, the consequences of these lawfare election interference shenanigans will become even more dire.

Crews named Adam Venit, a powerful industry figure who represented big names like Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Vince Vaughn, as the perpetrator of the crime. Crews filed a police report and lawsuit against Venit and his agency, William Morris Endeavor, in the aftermath of the incident.\n\nCrews's courageous act not only changed the national conversation about sexual harassment but also smashed stereotypes by proving that even a towering 240-pound former NFL player could be a victim. His bravery earned him a spot among Time's \"Silence Breakers\" named in the magazine's Person of the Year feature.\n\nNow, Crews's legal battle has finally come to an end as William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled. Venit, who had been suspended and demoted following Crews's allegations, is also planning to retire from the agency on Monday. Crews responded to the news of the settlement and Venit's departure with a simple yet powerful message: \"ACCOUNTABILITY.\"\n\nSince speaking out, Crews has been vocal about the need for accountability in the face of Hollywood's abuse of power. \"People need to be held accountable,\" he told \"Good Morning America\" last November. \"This is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he's one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, 'Who is going to believe you?'\"\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in December, Crews recounted the brutal sexual assault he endured at Venit's hands. \"Venit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews's penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,\" the lawsuit stated. Crews reported the incident to his own WME agent the next day, but the agency did nothing, according to his lawsuit, as part of a corporate culture that \"knowingly permits and encourages misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department launched a criminal investigation into the assault, but in March, prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of the lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases. However, the internal review at William Morris Endeavor found Crews's allegation about Venit indicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event.

However, during the ceremony in June, she and a man of similar age signed a genuine marriage certificate at a local government office and were officially married.\n\nAfter returning to Hong Kong, the woman discovered that she had been tricked by a friend, who informed her that it was a marriage scam. Due to a lack of evidence, the Hong Kong police were unable to take action. The victim sought help from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU), which held a press conference on Monday.\n\nDuring the press conference, the woman, who was wearing a mask, baseball cap, and dark sunglasses, claimed that she had applied for a Facebook listing for a makeup artist apprenticeship in May. The job offer promised a monthly salary of HKD14,000 (£1,385) with free training and no work experience. However, the alleged scammer convinced her to apply for a wedding planner position instead, telling her that she could earn more money that way.\n\nAfter signing the marriage certificate, the woman said she was told by the alleged scammer that they could ask the mayor to void the marriage record. She was given a week of free training in Hong Kong and was then told to participate in a mock wedding in Fuzhou to pass the course.\n\nThere have been 69 cases of job scams reported in the first half of this year, compared with 33 cases in the entire year of 2017, according to Apple Daily citing police figures. The motives behind the case are not yet known, but mainland residents with a spouse in Hong Kong can apply for a permit to settle in the city. The police are now investigating the case. The FTU also warned young people against potential job scams on the internet.",

That means that I hate, or does that mean that I actually love you and I do things out of spite?\" Scott asks.\n\n\"That's not a way to show your love!\" Kourtney insists. \"When someone's trying to f**k with me, I'm not into having them at my sister's party.\"\n\nA few back and forths later, Khloe finally jumps in.\n\n\"I am on the longest Ferris wheel of all time. Like, we gotta get off the ride at some point and get on a new one,\" Khloe says. But her words of wisdom don't seem to do much to help the situation, as Scott attempts to make up with Kourtney by asking if she wants \"to make out.\"\n\n\"You guys are so f**king dysfunctional. I don't know if this is something you guys do as foreplay, but this is f**king nuts,\" she yells. \"You two are so f**king nuts, seriously. And the fact that you waste my time when you guys are now just gonna go get mani pedis.\"\n\n\"We don't hook up,\" Kourtney laughs.\n\n\"You guys are f**king sick!\" Khloe responds.\n\nKourtney may not be hooking up with Scott -- but he's hooking up with Sofia Richie. See more on their romance in the video below.\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on E!]\n\nThe scene is filled with tension and emotions as Kourtney and Scott's relationship struggles come to a head. Kourtney feels hurt and betrayed by Scott's actions and words, while Scott is confused and hurt by Kourtney's response. Khloe, who is often a voice of reason and calm in the Kardashian family, tries to mediate and help them understand each other's perspectives.\n\nHowever, her words of wisdom fall on deaf ears as Scott continues to try to make amends with Kourtney, even offering to \"make out\" as a way to show his love. Kourtney, who has clearly been hurt and betrayed, is not interested in this and tells Scott that it's not a way to show love.\n\nKhloe's frustration and disbelief at the situation are clear as she yells at Kourtney and Scott, calling them \"f**king nuts\" and telling them that they are wasting her time. The emotional intensity of the scene is palpable as the struggles between Kourtney and Scott continue to play out in front of their family and friends.\n\nIn the end, it seems that Kourtney and Scott's relationship is still on shaky ground and that there is still a lot of unresolved tension and hurt between them. The scene ends with Khloe looking on in frustration as Kourtney and Scott continue to argue and struggle to come to terms with each other.",

The lawsuit against Jim Carrey, which was filed by his ex-girlfriend Cathriona White's estranged husband and mother, has taken a devastating turn.\n\nA note written by White, which was reportedly written in April 2013, has surfaced, alleging that Carrey introduced her to hard drugs and prostitutes. The opposition's lawyer has already accused Carrey of giving White three sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This new revelation only adds to the already tragic circumstances surrounding White's death.\n\nWhite, a 30-year-old makeup artist from Ireland, met Carrey in 2012 and dated on and off. Tragically, her body was discovered in her Los Angeles home in September 2015. She had intentionally overdosed on prescription medication that was supposedly provided by Carrey.\n\nThe wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey was filed by White's estranged husband, Mark Burton, and her mother, Brigid Sweetman, who amalgamated their complaints into one single case. There was some hope for a settlement out-of-court between the parties, but the lawsuit has only continued to get uglier.\n\nCarrey has filed a counter-complaint against Burton, Sweetman, and White's lawyer Filippo Machino, accusing them of extortion. In response to the counter-complaint, the opposition's lawyer Michael Avenatti released the 2013 letter.\n\nThe note, written on an iPad in Notes, was meant for Carrey and was released by Avenatti after the legal team uncovered it \"during a forensic examination of Ms. White's iPad.\" The note shows the depths of Carrey's destructive behavior and his treatment of White while she was alive.\n\nCarrey's lawyer Ray Boucher has stated that the note proves that the lawsuit is a fraud and that White, her lawyers, and others were trying to extort money from Carrey. Avenatti has responded by accusing Carrey of being incoherent and unhinged.\n\nThe case will go to trial in April 2018, and the medical records, which were previously permitted by the court to be used at trial, will determine whether White had any STIs prior to dating Carrey.\n\nI cannot imagine the pain and suffering that Cathriona White and her family must be going through. Her untimely death and the allegations against Carrey are devastating. I pray for her family and for justice to be served.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",

These new accusations are just the latest in a long line of allegations against Piven, who has been accused of following one woman into a trailer on the set of a movie, attempting to force himself on another woman in a hotel room, and more.\n\nSusan McCain Olson, an extra on the set of Lucas, Piven's very first film in 1985, bravely shared her story with BuzzFeed News. She claimed that Piven followed her into another actor's trailer and pushed her down on the couch, trying to kiss her and put his hands up her shirt. \"At one point I kind of was like, 'This is it, this is where I'm going to get raped,'\" McCain Olson said. \"I kept trying to push him away. I was like, 'No, get off me.'?She says she eventually was able to get him to leave, and decided not to tell anyone about the incident at the time because she was \"just an extra\" and didn't want to lose her job. But her bravery has sparked a much-needed conversation about the power dynamics in Hollywood and the importance of speaking out against sexual misconduct.\n\nAnother woman, who asked not to be identified, shared a similar story with BuzzFeed, describing an incident that allegedly happened in 1994, around the time Piven was filming a movie in Canada. She claimed that Piven pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, after which she pushed him off. She says she asked him what he thought he was doing, and he asked her what she came up to his room for. She left. \"I didn't want to stick around to find out what else was going to happen,\" she said.\n\nPiven and his lawyers released a statement denying all of the allegations. \"These allegations, which in one case go back more than 30 years and the two others more than 20 years ago, are false,\" Piven said. \"As evidenced by the lie detector test I took and passed, I have never forced myself on anyone, nor have I ever exposed myself or restrained anyone against their will. To the contrary, if any woman ever said no, I stopped.\"\n\nEight women in total have now accused Piven of sexual misconduct.

This is the fifth such allegation against the controversial director, who fled the US in 1977 after pleading guilty to statutory rape.\n\nMarianne Barnard, a respected artist, has revealed to the Sun that she was molested by Polanski in 1975, just two years before the director's escape to Europe. The alleged incident took place at a beach in California following a photoshoot, where Polanski asked Barnard to pose naked.\n\nBarnard, who suffers from PTSD and claustrophobia as a result of the abuse, says that Polanski initially took photos of her wearing a fur coat and a bikini, but later molested her when she was alone. She says that her mother left her and Polanski together, but that she doesn't know where her mother went.\n\nBarnard felt compelled to come forward now, following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and has reported the incident to the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division. She has also launched a petition calling for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to revoke Polanski's membership, as they have done with Weinstein.\n\nPolanski, who remains a fugitive from justice, has denied the allegations.

The heart of Keri Claussen Khalighi shattered as she revealed to Megyn Kelly that music mogul Russell Simmons privately apologized to her for sexually assaulting her. Despite his public insistence that what happened in 1991, when she was just 17 years old, was consensual, she exposed the truth.\n\n\"Russell and I have actually had a face-to-face confrontation about what happened,\" Khalighi told Kelly during a live interview from her home in Los Angeles with the NBC morning show host. \"We've had phone conversations where there was no dispute about what we were taking about, and he actually apologized.\"\n\nWhat's even more heartbreaking is that Khalighi revealed that what he's speaking about privately with her is completely different from what's come out publicly. \"Part of what's so confusing and re-traumatizing is that what he's speaking about privately with me is completely different from what's come out publicly,\" Khalighi said. \"That's the piece that's been, quite honestly, repugnant with hypocirsy and the lies and the denial.\"\n\nKhalighi, who is about to deliver her third child, recounted the details of the 1991 incident in a heart-wrenching manner. Simmons and Ratner invited her to their apartment on the pretext of seeing a music video they had produced. But as the video played, Khalighi said, Simmons began sexually assaulting her, forcing her to perform oral sex and later intercourse, all in Ratner's presence.\n\n\"I looked over at Brett and asked for help, because I thought he was a friend,\" Khalighi told Kelly, before realizing that \"this was their plan all along. There was no help that was gonna come.\" Khalighi said that \"in the fashion circles it was widely known that they had a reputation for being modelizers...\"\n\nSimmons denied the claim of assault to the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the story. In an emotional dialogue this morning between Khalighi and Kelly, the ex-model said that her story was complicated by the fact that after the first assault, she had taken a shower and returned, only to be assaulted by Simmons a second time.\n\n\"After the oral sex part of the story,\" she recalled, \"I stayed. I didn't run out. I stayed and I took a shower and an additional sexual assault happened there.\" Khalighi emphasized that women's stories of assault are not always cut-and-dried, black-and-white. \"I've learned in a lot of the work I've done around this issue there's a whole spectrum, a variety of response of fight, flight or freeze. I certainly froze. I did what I could to normalize what was an incredibly hard-to-process situation in the moment, as a 17-year-old.\"\n\nKhalighi's bravery in coming forward and speaking out against Simmons' assault has sent shockwaves and sparked conversations about sexual assault.

She also mentioned that Kanye played the game Connect 4 during the delivery of Chicago and that watching the surrogate birth Chicago was a \"good feeling.\"\n\nKim also spoke about her children, Saint and North, stating that Saint has an \"amazing vocabulary\" and may be a genius, while North has been \"better\" with Chicago than she was with Saint when he was first born, but that Saint is still the \"nicer\" one.\n\nFinally, the interview touched on Kim's extended feelings on Thompson, both now and even before the scandal hit.

Lopez chose the song because it fit into where the couple was in their relationship and because she felt it was relevant to their situation.\n\nSince entering the public eye in their early twenties, both Lopez and Rodriguez have experienced a lot of success and have had to deal with the effects it has had on their personal lives. However, Lopez feels that she has come a long way since her past relationships, including her marriage to chef Ojani Noa and dancer Cris Judd, and has come to know herself better.\n\nDespite the challenges that come with being in a relationship with an athlete, Lopez remains optimistic about the future of her relationship with Rodriguez and is committed to making it work for the long run. She believes that \"baseball is just like life\" and all you want to do is \"hit a home run.\"",

He was also romantically linked with Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis for nearly five years, but the relationship ended last year.

Nattie is devastated, and it's genuinely sad to see how the years of stress and worry have taken their toll on both of them. Bret Hart gives her some great advice and reminds her that her dad has to want sobriety for himself.\n\nThen, Nattie and TJ go to dinner with Bret and his wife, and Bret reminds her that her dad has to want sobriety for himself. This is actually great advice, and maybe Bret could start running his own advice column?\n\nLater, Nattie and Jim have a father-daughter autograph session that goes surprisingly smoothly. I have to wonder if being around wrestling again is that good an idea for the man, since it seems obvious it has too many temptations.\n\nBut that's not all, Brie is having a pregnancy scare when her period is two weeks late. She's sad because she genuinely thought she might be and is disappointed. She cries a lot, but thankfully, she has water-proof mascara. She wonders if she'll ever have a baby, and Nikki comforts her. \"You're going to have a baby. It's going to happen.\" I like the idea of a \"Psychic Nikki\" gimmick.\n\nBrie and Daniel have a fertility check, and I don't know where this storyline is going. Maybe it turns out they do have problems and they have to ask Nikki to be a surrogate? Or perhaps they end up adopting some mysterious child from an orphanage who turns out to be a psycho killer and/or possessed by a demon? (Note to self: stop watching so many horror movies.)\n\nBut that's not all, Brie takes her mind off of her anxieties over motherhood by trashing Eva Marie again and saying how she doesn't \"care about the business.\" She's training every day, what more do they want? For her to erect a shrine to Shawn Michaels in her living around that she prays to everyday while watching '90s Japanese wrestling tapes on a never-ending loop?\n\nBrian Kendrick encourages Eva to shake off the heat from the rest of the girls. He is great. Now I want a reality show where Bret and Brian just hang out all the time and act cool while occasionally giving sage advice to emotionally troubled wrestlers. And Paul London in a supporting role as the wacky neighbor.\n\nTrinity, one of the few sane divas on this show, correctly points out how unreasonable the women's hatred of Eva is and that they're all jealous. Whether or not they will pay any attention to her is another matter entirely. I really don't know what Eva is supposed to have done wrong here...other than taking the same opportunities the other girls undoubtedly wish they'd had.\n\nAnd finally, Paige has to get a WrestleMania makeover, which means buying a gown and nice shoes because she doesn't own any?you know, because she's such a tomboy! And getting a tan. Paige is annoyed about the latter since she loves being pale. But this is the law in wrestling, everyone has to be orange, and Paige doesn't want to be glamorous. Later, she meets her biggest fan, who credits her for saving her life and helping cure her eating disorder by being herself. This makes Paige realize she's happier being her own person and doesn't want to be glamorous. Nice scene but it felt a bit contrived and scripted even by this show's standards. What, she just happened to bump into this fan who reminded her to be true to herself while getting a makeover she didn't really want?

According to Life & Style magazine, Prince William suggested to the Queen that his pregnant wife, Kate, reduce her royal duties permanently. Life & Style reports that Kate wants to limit her public appearances as a full-time mother to her children, George and Charlotte.\n\nThe Queen is said to be反对 to Kate's request, as she has had similar experiences as a mother and working royal. The Queen was 25 with two young children (Charles and Anne) when her father passed away and ascended to the throne, and she went on to have two more children (Andrew and Edward) after her coronation, often leaving her children at home with nursery staff while she was on official tours.\n\nThe Queen's experiences may be the reason for her disapproval of Kate and William's decision. Prince Charles's authorized biography claims that he found his parents emotionally reserved, with the nursery staff playing a significant role in his upbringing.\n\nThis is not the first time the Queen has disagreed with the parenting style of younger generations of the royal family. She reportedly opposed William's mother Diana's decision to take him on tour to Australia and New Zealand when he was nine months old.\n\nDespite the disagreement, William and Kate have taken a more modern approach to parenting than their ancestors, sending George to a local Montessori nursery in Norfolk and then to Thomas's in Battersea for his first day of school.",

Kerry Ehrin, who previously worked on Bates Motel and Rise, is set to take over from Jay Carson on the tech giant's Jennifer Aniston-Reese Witherspoon morning show drama. Production studio Media Res and Apple have parted ways with Carson following \"creative differences\" on the untitled morning show project.\n\nEhrin will move to Apple with an exclusive overall development and production deal that includes showrunning duties on the series. The morning show drama landed at Apple in a competitive situation with multiple outlets bidding. Apple has handed out a two-season, 20-episode order for the series, marking its first order under new heads of video programming Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht.\n\nThe series is based on an original concept by Media Res' Michael Ellenberg and will provide additional background for the show. Witherspoon and Aniston will also executive produce and co-own the show. Sources note that the two stars are earning more than $1.25 million per episode for their starring and exec producing roles on the series and will also receive a cut of the show's back-end.\n\nEhrin's move to Apple comes after she served as co-showrunner alongside Carlton Cuse on A&E's Psycho prequel TV series Bates Motel. Sources say Ehrin landed at Apple in a competitive situation with other studios vying to sign the veteran writer, producer, and showrunner. Apple has been on an aggressive buying spree, landing series from M. Night Shyamalan, Outlander's Ron Moore, La La Land's Damien Chazelle, and others.\n\nEhrin's deal comes as streaming giant Netflix has been making an aggressive push to sign top producers to overall deals after forging nine-figure pacts with Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy.

Therefore, this part of the message is likely to be real.\n\n2. **Claim about Bieber's donation**: This claim is disputed by Carl Lentz, who is directly involved with Hillsong. Lentz denies Bieber donated $10 million to the church. Lentz's position adds credibility against the initial claim.\n\n3. **Details about Hillsong's properties**: Lentz's statement that Hillsong does not have a gold roof or own a church building contradicts specific details mentioned in the original claim. Lentz's role as a pastor at Hillsong makes his correction credible.\n\nConsidering these points, the message contains some details that are plausible (Post Malone's concerns about Bieber) and others that are contradicted (Bieber's donation and Hillsong's properties) by a credible source directly involved (Carl Lentz).\n\n**Verdict**: Given the direct contradiction by Carl Lentz, a key figure at Hillsong, it is more likely that the specific claims about Bieber's donation and Hillsong's properties are not accurate.

I feel like it's kind of a service to do that.”\n\nIn the interview, Grant also defended the title of her upcoming book, \"The Diary of Princess Pushy's Sister,\" insisting that it was not negative and that she did not write a \"slamming tell-all.\" She explained that she chose the title as a mockery of tabloids who previously referred to her sister as \"Princess Pushy.\"\n\nGrant also addressed Prince Harry's comment that Markle was getting \"the family I suppose that she's never had,\" stating that he was simply referring to the family being in one place. \"I think he was referring to the family all being in one place —children running around, a large gathering. It's lovely that she can have that,\" she said.\n\nDespite Grant's previous negative comments about her sister, she expressed that she would love to be invited to the royal wedding. \"Invitations haven't gone out yet, but I hope so. Of course I would like to be there,\" she said.\n\nThis interview will no doubt add fuel to the fire surrounding Meghan Markle's royal romance, as her half-sister continues to speak out on her behalf. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.",

But this is no ordinary high school girl - she's a girl with an extraordinary spirit, who delivers Kim's confidence, smarts, and agility with aplomb.\n\nSadie Stanley, a 16-year-old from South Carolina, landed the role in her first-ever audition. She has since guest-starred on Game Shakers, and we can't wait to see her bring Kim's spirit to life.\n\nSean Giambrone, 18, stars in ABC's hit comedy The Goldbergs and will film Kim Possible before returning to production of that series. He's a magnetic actor who always finds the right balance of physical comedy and heart, and we know he'll bring Ron's heart to the screen.\n\nThe movie will be directed by Adam B. Stein and Zach Lipovsky, who were finalists on Fox's directing competition On the Lot. Blyth Nailling is the casting director, and the script will be written by Emmy-winning series creators and executive producers Mark McCorkle & Robert Schooley and Josh Cagan.\n\nKim Possible is an animated comedy/adventure series that launched in 2002 and followed the adventures of a strong teenager who uses her brain, heart, and expertise to save the day. Throughout 87 episodes, Kim Possible traversed the social hierarchy of high school and, with her loyal sidekick Ron Stoppable and his naked mole-rat Rufus by her side, thwarted power-hungry villains Drakken and Shego, among others.\n\nThe series inspired two popular animated original movies, Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama in 2005, which was the first animated title in the Disney Channel Original Movie franchise, and Kim Possible: A Stitch in Time in 2003. It also led to an off-TV franchise including Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable characters at Disney Parks & Resorts and a line of Kim Possible branded consumer products at mass retail, soundtracks, books, and games.\n\nThe series has been recognized with numerous awards, including the Parents' Choice Foundation, the International Animated Film Society's Annie Awards, and Italy's Pulcinella Award for Best Program and Best TV Series for Children.\n\nThis movie will be a celebration of everything we love about Kim Possible - the courage, the heart, and the extraordinary spirit of a girl who dared to be herself and save the world.

Despite Baio's insistence that they had sex only once, when she was 18 years old, the D.A. has deemed the case \"potentially prosecutable.\"\n\nHowever, the statute of limitations has proven to be a major obstacle in bringing Baio to justice. At the time the alleged assaults occurred in the 1980s, the statute of limitations was three years, and as a result, it has expired.\n\nWhile some argue that cases from the past could still be prosecuted if the statute had not run out when the law was changed, in this instance, the statute expired before the law was updated.

Despite her talent and success, not everyone loves Swift or her music, which has been labeled as simple and unfussy with inane platitudes.\n\nThe Guardian has called Swift's response to Nicki Minaj's criticism of the music industry \"faux-feminist\" and \"tone deaf,\" while The Atlantic accuses Swift of using the pretext of female solidarity to shut down Minaj's frustration with the industry. The media and press have bowed to Swift's every move, but a new Gawker piece documents a substantial amount of over-the-top praise for Swift, suggesting that there may be something more opportunistic and sinister at play.\n\nThe ultraviolent \"Bad Blood\" video, which has gained attention, may be seen as bloodthirsty, especially given that much of her audience is young girls. Dayna Evans's Gawker piece argues that the video perfectly illustrates Swift's ruthlessness and feminist posing, with a plan to be as famous and rich as possible, using other women as tools of her self-promotion.\n\nSwift has smart and savvy people working for her, and she is a master of PR.

After seven seasons of watching Jess, Nick, Schmidt, Cece, Winston, and Aly navigate their way through the ups and downs of life in their Los Angeles loft, it was finally time to say goodbye.\n\nFor many viewers, New Girl had its perfect series finale at the end of season 6, when Jess and Nick shared a sweet, passionate kiss after repeated failed attempts to end up in the same place in their loft. The series finale, however, decided to take a different approach.\n\nThe finale of New Girl was split into two distinct parts, each bringing a different but equally important sense of closure to the series. The first half, 'The Curse of the Pirate Bride', was a payoff to seven seasons worth of on-again, off-again romantic tension between Nick and Jess. The episode unfolds like an anxiety dream, with Jess and Nick facing obstacles at every turn, including Jess's mom showing up to chastise the couple for spending the night before their wedding together.\n\nThe second half, 'Engram Pattersky', sees the group of friends reluctantly packing their belongings as they prepare to leave the loft. The episode teeters on the verge of becoming a trip down memory lane, with Jess insisting that the core group gather to help pack since she and Nick are being evicted.\n\nIn the end, New Girl's finale delivered both the wedding that was promised and the goodbye that was needed, without letting the audience down. The show's finale is a testament to the power of spending time with these weird, lovably obnoxious people, and for one final time, Liz Meriwether and the New Girl crew figured out a satisfying way to make that what fans will ultimately remember the show for.",

However, she also admitted that at one point, they joked that Jenner would have a baby too, which turned out to be accurate.\n\nKardashian's prediction about Jenner having a baby was almost 100% accurate, considering that the upcoming season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which will hopefully include Jenner's pregnancy and the birth of Stormi, is Season 15.

As far as what she has shared on social media, it seems like motherhood definitely agrees with her.\n\nIn the end, no matter who is pregnant when, the Kardashian-Jenner family is here for each other, and that is what is most important.

        "content": "EXCLUSIVE: Terry Crews Files Lawsuit Against Hollywood Agent for Alleged Sexual Assault!\n\nThe stunning sexual assault case involving Terry Crews has taken a dramatic turn as the actor has filed a lawsuit against his alleged attacker, William Morris Endeavor agent Adam Venit. Crews has accused Venit of assault, battery, and sexual harassment, among other charges, in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.\n\nThe lawsuit comes just a month after Crews made his allegations public on Twitter, though not naming Venit specifically. After Crews' allegation, Venit was suspended from WME and was later demoted to a lower-level role within the company.\n\nThe alleged incident occurred on Feb. 4, 2016, at an industry event hosted by Adam Sandler. According to the complaint obtained by USA TODAY, Venit stared at Crews intently, like a rabid dog, sticking his tongue in and out of his mouth provocatively. Venit then viciously grabbed Crews' penis and testicles, causing him immediate pain. Crews shoved Venit back, knocking him into several people who were standing nearby. However, Venit continued to leer at Crews and grabbed and squeezed his genitals again. Crews says he asked Sandler for help, and Sandler was shocked by Venit's behavior.\n\nCrews, a WME client before he formally left the company in mid-November, says he informed his agent at the company the next day, but the agency took little action. The lawsuit alleges that WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in sexually predatory conduct in order to assert their power and clout over others.\n\nCrews is seeking punitive and exemplary damages for the alleged assault, which he says caused him actual pain as well as psychological issues. Venit's client roster includes several Hollywood names who have been accused of harassment, including Sylvester Stallone, Casey Affleck, Brett Ratner, and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nThis is a developing story, and Crews' lawsuit has been reported by multiple outlets, including TMZ and Deadline Hollywood. Stay tuned for further updates.",

But now, even if he spends time in the sun, he rarely gets a burn. He attributes this to his water consumption, as he believes that staying hydrated helps protect the skin from the harmful effects of the sun.\n\nWhile we agree that drinking plenty of water is an important part of a healthy diet, we must emphasize that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that drinking water can prevent sunburns. In fact, many medical authorities, including the American Academy of Dermatology, the Center for Disease Control, the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, and the Skin Cancer Foundation, all recommend using sunscreen and other protective measures to prevent sunburns.\n\nTom's advice to drink water to prevent sunburns may be amusing to some, but it is not a reliable or effective method of sun protection. To truly protect yourself from the sun, it is important to follow the advice of experts and use a high-quality sunscreen, seek shade when possible, cover up with clothing and hats, avoid the middle of the day when the sun's rays are strongest, and wear sunglasses to protect your eyes.\n\nWhile we understand that spending time in the sun can be enjoyable, it is important to prioritize your health and take the necessary precautions to protect yourself from the sun's harmful effects.

The atmosphere was relaxed, with Meghan playing 1950s music to keep everyone calm. Meghan was not nervous and remained her usual self, according to Martin.\n\nThe wedding dress was the moment when the reality of the situation hit for Martin and the rest of the team. \"It was all so easy.

Jay-Z leads the pack with eight nods, including Album of the Year for his critically acclaimed album \"4:44.\" However, this year marks a significant change in the Grammy nominations, as for the first time in 19 years, there are no white men nominated for the album category.\n\nThis absence has led to a Twitter \"moment,\" as the social media platform announced that the \"Grammys album category has no white men for the first time in 19 years.\" This is a notable achievement, considering the criticism that surrounded the Grammys last year when Adele's \"25\" won over Beyoncé's \"Lemonade.\"\n\nHowever, this absence is not solely due to the exclusion of white men. Alternative rock band Garbage, led by lead singer Shirley Manson, has also been making waves in the music industry. In fact, if you count Garbage and search through every other album of the year category since the Grammys started in 1959, this actually marks the first time in history that no white men have been nominated for the night's biggest prize.\n\nThis achievement is especially significant for the Grammys, which saw lots of criticism last year when Adele's \"25\" won over Beyoncé's \"Lemonade.\" The year before that, Taylor Swift's \"1989\" beat Lamar's \"To Pimp a Butterfly.\" And the year before that, Beyoncé's self-titled album lost to Beck's \"Morning Phase.\"\n\nRecording Academy president Neil Portnow acknowledged the diversity of this year's nominees and credited it to the large pool of voting members; there are about 13,000 overall. Plus, the Grammys opened up online voting for the first time this year, which led to a wider range of ballots than usual.\n\n\"The results are reflecting the music of the times ?hip-hop and urban music is pervasive in our society worldwide ?not just in America,\" Portnow said. \"So when that continues to be evident and evolve, this is a reflection of that.\"\n\nHe also explained that Sheeran being relegated to the pop album category is not necessarily a snub but simply indicative of where the voters thought he belonged.\n\n\"In terms of Ed and the recordings he made, certainly our voters thought highly of him and he is nominated [for two awards].

And now, the afternoon is keeping pace with some old-fashioned, skinny-shaming, joke-missing outrage, all centered around an interview Stassi Schroeder gave to Daily Mail Australia.\n\nWhen asked how she maintains her trim figure, despite a schedule that seems pretty well packed with work and social obligations, Stassi had this to say: \"I’m really lazy,\" she told the outlet. \"I stay thin by trying to starve myself for the most part, if I’m being honest. When I’m home in Los Angeles, it’s like one meal a day.\"\n\nThis is a heartbreaking example of the danger of print interviews. If Stassi had tearfully confessed that she starves herself, the Mail would’ve said so. As it is, they didn’t describe her inflection at all, so we think it’s safe to say that Stassi wasn’t actually opening up to a group of Aussie strangers about her eating disorder, but was instead simply joking.\n\nBut her diet is far from the most dramatic element of Stassi’s life these days. On last night’s episode of Vanderpump, viewers finally got to meet her longtime on-again, off-again boyfriend, Patrick Meagher. Because people on the internet are easily confused, the appearance sparked rumors that Stassi and Patrick are back together.

The outlet also claims that this is \"frustrating\" for Princess Eugenie, who has been \"trying so hard to be noticed in recent weeks.\"\n\nHowever, a royal source has told Gossip Cop that the story is \"rubbish.\" Princess Eugenie understands that her cousins have a lot going on at the moment, particularly with engagements and pregnancies.

According to an exclusive source, Jenner is second-guessing her decision to have a child with Travis Scott, despite his rocky relationship with her. The source claims that Jenner misses her ex, Tyga, who was always present and caring, and is beginning to think he would have made a better baby daddy.\n\nJenner and Scott have been together for just a few months, which may not have been the most solid foundation for a child. The couple's relationship has also been rocky, with Jenner noting that Scott has been absent from her life. The source adds that Jenner has been having trouble sleeping at night, worrying about her decision to have a child with Scott.\n\nJenner's decision to have a child with Scott came just a month after she ended her nearly three-year relationship with Tyga. Tyga has already shown that he is a great dad to their son, King Cairo, and Jenner may be wondering if Scott will be a similar support system for their child. It remains to be seen whether Jenner and Scott will be able to work through their issues and provide a stable home for their child.",

With no clear front-runner, any of the 16 players on our list could take home the award.\n\nWe put together a bracket two weeks ago and asked fans to decide who they thought was the best. The winner? Tennessee's Grant Williams, who beat Indiana's Juwan Morgan in the final round.\n\nBut Williams isn't just any player. In his sophomore campaign last season, he averaged 15.2 points, 6 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks, earning him SEC Player of the Year honors on a Tennessee team that went 26-9 overall and finished in first place in the conference with a 13-5 record.\n\nThis season, Williams will have plenty of help as he tries to lead Tennessee past the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2014. Tennessee returns all five starters and all six of its leading scorers.\n\nOur tournament of preseason player of the year candidates featured 16 student-athletes, seeded No. 1 through No. 16, in a four-round, single-elimination format. Voting was conducted on the @MarchMadness Twitter and Instagram accounts, and the student-athlete with more fan votes in each matchup advanced to the next round.\n\nBelow are the results from each round of voting. The numbers at the end indicate the percentage of votes on Twitter:\n\nFinals results:\n\n(13) Grant Williams def. (15) Juwan Morgan (57-43)\n\nSemifinals results:\n\n(13) Grant Williams def. (1) Carsen Edwards (55-45)\n\n(15) Juwan Morgan def. (3) Ethan Happ (52-48)\n\nSecond round results:\n\n(1) Carsen Edwards def. (8) Caleb Martin (66-34)\n\n(13) Grant Williams def.

(9) Rui Hachimura (54-46)\n\nHere are our 1-16 rankings:\n\nPreseason All-Americans (seed)\n\n(1) Carsen Edwards, Jr., G, Purdue: Should average nearly 20 points a game and be the reason the Boilermakers are in the mix in the Big Ten ?making him a favorite for national player of the year.\n\n(2) Zion Williamson, Fr., F, Duke: Williamson is a physical specimen that will dominate his position and be must-see every time out.\n\n(3) Ethan Happ, Sr., F, Wisconsin: Happ has maximized everything out of his career and will lead the Badgers back to the NCAA tournament.\n\n(4) R.J. Barrett, Fr., F, Duke: Barrett will provide a bookend to Williamson as the pair has the potential to average in the high teens every game.\n\n(5) Luke Maye, Sr., F, North Carolina: Few players in the country have improved as much as Maye has in his career. He is the anchor for a team that could make a play for the title.\n\n(6) Dedric Lawson, Jr., F, Kansas: The Memphis transfer could/should be the Big 12 player of the year and as a result be in contention for national honors, leading the Jayhawks to a possible top seed.\n\n(7) Kyle Guy, Jr., G, Virginia: Guy is determined to erase the memory of the UMBC loss by taking the Cavs back to the top of the ACC. Guy has become one of the more reliable shooters under Tony Bennett.\n\n(8) Caleb Martin, F, Sr., Nevada: Martin came back instead of staying in the NBA draft to join the most talented Wolf Pack roster ever. He has a chance to create a legacy with a trip to the Final Four.\n\n(9) Rui Hachimura, Jr., F, Gonzaga: Hachimura has improved mightily in each season. He continues to embrace the role of being a go-to player on a roster that should make a run for the title.\n\n(10) Tyus Battle, G, Jr., Syracuse: Battle flirted with staying in the NBA draft but he returns to lead the Orange a few steps further than the Sweet 16 last season. His numbers climbed during the season and he should be one of the more consistent scorers in the ACC.\n\n(11) Shamarie Ponds, Jr., G, St. John’s: Ponds enters the season as one of the favorites for Big East player of the year. He is a must-watch guard who will have MSG rocking this season as the Red Storm rise toward an NCAA bid.\n\n(12) Markus Howard, Jr., G, Marquette: Howard put up 52 in a road game at Providence. He could be one of the top scorers in the country. He’ll battle with Ponds for Big East player of the year and lead the Golden Eagles back to the NCAAs.\n\n(13) Grant Williams, Jr., F, Tennessee: The SEC player of the year has a shot to go back-to-back as the best in the league with the top team in the conference. The Vols and Williams will compete for both throughout the season.\n\n(14) Jordan Murphy, Sr., F, Minnesota: Murphy is a double-double machine, averaging over 16 and 11 each night out. Expect those numbers to rise as will the Gophers?win total toward an NCAA bid.\n\n(15) Juwan Morgan, Sr., F, Indiana: Morgan has a high-profile co-star in freshman Romeo Langford. But Morgan will hold his own as a possible Big Ten player of the year candidate and one of the reasons the Hoosiers will thrive.\n\n(16) Mike Daum, Sr., F, South Dakota State: The Jackrabbits could lead the country in scoring. He’s a likely lock to score at least 20 a game. And the Jackrabbits are due for a win in the NCAA tournament.",

Judd, who spoke to The New York Times for the first blockbuster story about Weinstein, said at the time, \"Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.\"\n\nIn December, Peter Jackson revealed that executives at Miramax had told him that Judd and Sorvino were \"a nightmare to work with\" and that they should be avoided at all costs. This was likely a part of the Miramax smear campaign against the actresses, and Jackson now suspects that false information was being fed to him about their talent.\n\nSorvino responded to Jackson's revelation with an emotional tweet, and Judd and Sorvino spoke about the goals of the Time's Up movement during the Vanity Fair Oscar Party. \"I want people to know that this movement isn’t stopping, we’re going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women,\" Sorvino said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Judd will present an award alongside two other women who have accused Weinstein: Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek. Sciorra, who claimed to The New Yorker that Weinstein raped her and that her career suffered as a result, seemed visibly overwhelmed to be onstage.\n\nThe united presence of Judd and Sorvino on the red carpet was a reminder of the striking and symbolic impact that a red carpet appearance can have.

Well, that's exactly how some Vanderpump Rules fans are feeling right now. The rumors are true, Lala Kent, Stassi Schroeder, and Katie Maloney have not only reconciled, they're actually having a BLAST together!\n\nThe news of their unlikely friendship began to spread like wildfire when Brittany Cartwright posted a picture of the four of them, smiling and having the time of their lives in Mexico. At first, many of us chose to remain skeptical, but when we saw the same happiness in their faces as they documented their trip, it was impossible to ignore the truth.\n\nThese three women, who have spent the past two seasons of Vanderpump Rules feuding and accusing each other of lies, have seemingly made peace and formed a bond that can only be described as a miracle. And yet, not everyone is celebrating. Jeremy Madix, who is rumored to be joining the cast, couldn't help but express his disdain for Lala's new friends on one of her posts.\n\nIt's hard to believe that just two seasons ago, Lala, Katie, and Stassi were at each other's throats, accusing each other of dating married men and causing drama that kept viewers on the edge of their seats. But now, it seems like they've put all that behind them and are ready to start anew.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the future of Vanderpump Rules? Will Lala, Katie, and Stassi's friendship last? Will it be a sign of hope for a brighter future, or just a fleeting moment of happiness before everything falls apart again? And most importantly, how are Scheana and Ariana feeling about all of this? The answers to these questions may just determine whether or not we'll be tuning in to season 6 of VPR.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes and Soundcloud.

Here's a possible rewrite:\n\nRebecca Bunch, the co-creator and star of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, has taken on several pop star personas in the show's Season 3 opening credits sequence. The new sequence, premiering tonight, showcases different strains of crazy, including a Carrie Underwood-type with a Louisville slugger, a sultry diva who's crazy in love, a rock star who likes a woman who's \"crazy in bed,\" and a rapper who warns of a girl who's \"crazy in the head.\"\n\nThe theme of the sequence, \"To be crazy or not to be crazy,\" is confusing to Rebecca herself. As she sits on the toilet, watching the chaos unfold on her phone, she reveals she's more confused than ever. The song, inspired by Underwood's \"Before He Cheats,\" is disjointed and plodding, flying by quickly and ending abruptly. It never really registers as a cohesive opener, and that's probably the point. Pop's obsession with the word crazy inspired the aesthetic, as Rebecca tries to live her life by those things.\n\nThe Season 3 opening credits sequence is a letdown compared to previous seasons. While it makes smart points about women being told one of the worst things to be is \"crazy,\" except when in bed with a man, it doesn't subvert them through imagery. The four strains of \"crazy\" pop stars offer \"We hope this helps!\" to Rebecca, but it's hard not to answer with, \"No, no.

Watch the Epic Clash!\n\nStephen Colbert is at it again, and this time he's taking aim at the one and only, President Donald Trump! The late night host used his platform at the 2017 Emmy Awards to mercilessly mock the president, much to the delight of his adoring fans.\n\nColbert began his opening act by doing a song-and-dance number, poking fun at the various shows up for an Emmy this year. But there was a hidden message in there, a subtle jab at Trump. Can you guess what it is? The chorus of the song? \"Everything is better on TV—including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, 'treason'.\"\n\nOnce he finally took the stage, Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. But he quickly pivoted to his Trump jokes, saying, \"If he had won an Emmy, I bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he's just Walter, much whiter.\"\n\nBut Colbert wasn't done yet. He had one final jab at the president before he left the stage. He brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer! Spicer appeared on stage behind a lectern to comment on the TV Academy gala's crowd size, saying, \"This is the biggest audience to witness an Emmys, period, both in person and around the world.\"\n\nColbert's response? \"Wow, that really soothes my fragile ego. Give it up for Melissa McCarthy, everybody.\"\n\nThis is just the latest in a long line of Trump jokes from Colbert, who has been honing his voice as David Letterman's replacement on The Late Show with Trump.

The magazine claims that Shelton was \"shocked\" when Stefani told him to \"sign on the dotted line,\" which would provide her with $5 million if he were to cheat, as well as the \"Oklahoma compound Blake gifted her.\" As to whether the prenup is a deal-breaker, Stefani's representative shockingly admits to Gossip Cop.\n\nIn a bombshell story, OK! reports that Jennifer Aniston \"can't help but reflect\" on her past with Brad Pitt. The magazine claims that Aniston often wonders what might have happened if she and Pitt had kids and even looks at her old engagement ring once a year. As to why she is still \"stuck on the past,\" Aniston's representative leaks the information to Gossip Cop.\n\nStar also reports that Suri Cruise made a \"heartbreaking plea\" to see Tom Cruise after \"1,487 days apart.\" The magazine claims that the 11-year-old asked her father when she could see him, and that Cruise is now considering a \"face-to-face visit with his little girl.\" Gossip Cop has obtained exclusive details from Katie Holmes' representative.\n\nIn Touch claims that Kylie Jenner is \"pregnant and dumped\" by Travis Scott. The magazine says that the two had a fight because Jenner has been \"pushing\" Scott to marry her, but he is \"not ready.\" As to whether Jenner will raise the baby on her own, Gossip Cop has obtained an exclusive response from her representative.\n\nFinally, OK! reports that Taylor Swift is living a \"lonely life,\" having stopped hanging out with friends and rarely leaving her house.

The reason for this sudden attention is not their dashing appearance or their stunning Tom Ford tuxedos, but rather their choice to self-tan.\n\nThis revelation has left many people, including myself, in a state of disbelief. I, along with millions of other women, have always admired the bronzed appearance of male celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney, and Bradley Cooper. We have always believed that having a tan, whether natural or artificial, makes a man look healthier and more attractive.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a stigma surrounding men using self-tanning products. It is often perceived as a sign of insecurity or a desperate attempt to look younger. But is this really the case?\n\nSelf-tanning products have become increasingly popular among both men and women, and there are many benefits to using them. For instance, a self-tan can help to accentuate muscles, cover imperfections, smooth out skin tone, and even mask cellulite. Additionally, it can help to boost confidence and make a person more attractive to the opposite sex.\n\nThere are many self-tanning products specifically designed for men, and they are just as effective as their female counterparts. Self-tanning can be used on an ongoing basis to maintain a healthy glow, rather than relying on tanning beds or sun exposure, which can lead to skin cancer and wrinkles.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why men should feel encouraged to use self-tanning products. It is a safe and natural alternative to tanning beds and sun exposure, and it can have numerous benefits for both men and women. So, the next time you see a man with a nice tan, don't be surprised, it's just another sign of a man taking pride in his appearance.",

        "content": "On Thursday, a new article was released in which the author posed the question to country singer Miranda Lambert about her potential involvement in political activism. When asked if she believed there was an opportunity for her to create issue-oriented songs like Loretta Lynn, Lambert responded that she was a firm believer in not using her platform for anything other than music. She felt that music was an escape from reality and did not want to be subjected to political preaching during her shows. When pressed, Lambert reiterated her stance and felt that political discussions would only lead to division and not necessarily result in a change of opinion.\n\nLambert's decision to avoid political activism aligns with that of another female country icon, Reba McEntire, who argued on \"The View\" that entertainers should not discuss politics. In a separate interview with Billboard, Lambert discussed her decision not to do press for her album, The Weight of These Wings, in order to avoid discussing her divorce from Blake Shelton. She simply did not feel the need to talk about the record.\n\nIn the article, Lambert also revealed that she co-wrote \"Vice\" the day the split from Shelton became public in 2015. She stated that she approached the situation \"with guns blazing\" and did not want to create a breakup record. She felt that the song was the perfect way to express her feelings about the situation and did not want to give away any more details than necessary. Overall, Lambert's decision to avoid political activism and keep her music focused on her personal experiences aligns with her desire to provide an escape for her listeners.",

Despite the challenges they've faced, they've come so far and it's amazing to see. Family relationships can be complicated and there's no one right way to do things. Each family is unique, and sometimes it takes a lot of trial and error to figure out what works best. I can relate to Melissa's desire to make her parents feel loved and special, even if it means going to great lengths.\n\nI also have to give props to Teresa for her discipline in this fitness competition. While I may not have the same level of ambition, I can appreciate the stress-relieving benefits of working out. However, I don't think I could ever have the same level of discipline as her, even if I wanted to.\n\nAs for Marge, I love her fierce business sense and the idea of her pajama line is intriguing. But the fact that she sleeps naked is just too much information for me!\n\nDolores and Frank's relationship serves as a great example of how divorced couples should behave. They are truly amazing role models. As for Frankie Jr., I hope he takes time to visit his mom and show her some love.\n\nI must say, I was worried about how Dolores would react to Danielle. Paterson Dolores is a force to be reckoned with, and I can only imagine the kind of reaction she would have.\n\nI wish Melissa a very happy birthday, and I can't wait to see what she gets up to at Rails. The party looks like it's going to be a blast, especially with Melissy drinking her weight in water.\n\nAs for arranged marriages and chaperoned dates, I have a story to share. I met my husband in a unique way, and it was love at first sight. We knew we were meant to be together, and our families approved. We got married on Labor Day of 2002, and it was the event of the year.\n\nNow, back to Melissa's party. The cake is absolutely stunning, and I love that she doesn't take herself too seriously. The fact that cake is flying everywhere and nobody cares is just a testament to the joy that comes with celebrating life.\n\nThank you for letting me share my story with you. I hope it has touched your heart and reminded you of the love and joy that exists in the world.",

It was a poignant moment that Fallon kept to himself until he performed on the show.\n\nAs Swift sang \"New Year's Day,\" a song from her album Reputation, she sang the lyrics \"You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi.\" The coincidence was too much for many in the audience, who couldn't help but sob at the beauty of the moment.\n\nSwift's performance was not planned, but Fallon asked her to come on a last-minute act of kindness. Swift agreed, and her performance was met with overwhelming emotion.\n\nFallon was visibly moved by Swift's performance, and the pair shared a heartfelt embrace after the song. Swift's gesture was an act of love and kindness, and it left a lasting impact on Fallon and the entire audience.",

Paris herself also clarified the situation on Twitter, stating that she has never been exclusively with either Cara or Caroline, and that Caroline is actually one of her best friends who is married and has a child.\n\nThe report suggesting that Paris needs to choose one of the women exclusively has been met with criticism from those who advocate for greater acceptance of non-heteronormative sexuality.

She began her modelling career at the young age of three and went on to appear in a variety of beauty pageants.\n\nIt was in 2015 that Telli and Deontay crossed paths for the first time. According to Telli, they saw each other at check-in, then again at TSA, before Deontay finally spoke to her while they were both going to their gates.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until two weeks before their family reunion in Alabama that things really took off between them. According to Telli, Deontay reached out to her via Instagram DMs after she was released from the hospital following an infection in her leg.\n\nDespite initially being reluctant to propose, Deontay eventually did so on an episode of Wags Atlanta. He said, \"I love the girl though. She got my heart. That's my baby, that's my best friend.\"\n\nThe proposal took place on February 15, 2018, and was timed to coincide with their child's gender reveal party, where they found out they were having a daughter.\n\nThis will be Deontay's second marriage, as he divorced his first wife, Jessica Scales-Wilder, in 2017 after eight years of marriage. Telli has kept a low profile since then, focusing on being a partner to Deontay and a mother to their daughter.\n\nTogether, Deontay and Telli have faced many challenges, including the pressure that comes with being in the public eye. However, they have stood strong and supported each other through it all.\n\nAs they prepare for their future together, let us celebrate the love story of Deontay Wilder and Telli Swift - a love story that is truly inspiring and a testament to the power of true love.",

But there is one member missing from the line-up - Victoria Beckham, also known as Posh Spice.\n\nThe news of the Spice Girls reunion tour was announced on social media by Geri Horner, Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton, and Melanie Brown, who will be joined by Mel C, Sporty Spice, Baby Spice, and Scary Spice. The tour is set to be something special, with tickets selling like hot cakes and breaking Ticketmaster UK's records.\n\nHowever, Victoria Beckham's absence from the tour has left many fans heartbroken. There have been rumors that she is focusing on her own fashion brand, but the real reason behind her decision to not take part in the tour may be much simpler. During her acceptance speech at the People's Choice Awards 2018, Victoria admitted that she had hung up her microphone some time ago and gets scared when she gets up on stage.\n\nShe also revealed that seeing Elton John perform in 2008 made her realize that she didn't want to perform anymore. She explained that there was nothing there for her, unlike Elton John who had a passion and enjoyment for his music that she couldn't have.\n\nEven without Victoria Beckham, the Spice Girls tour is set to be something special. The girls have already announced their much-hyped tour on social media in a news broadcast parody, and tickets are selling like hot cakes. The tour kicks off on Wednesday 29 May at the Manchester Etihad Stadium, and concludes with a three night stint at the Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nSo if you'd like to experience this once in a lifetime UK stadium tour, you'd better act quickly because tickets are selling like hot cakes.

In a statement following her death, her family said that Messick was \"collateral damage\" in the story.\n\nIn January 1997, Messick set up a meeting between McGowan and Weinstein during the Sundance Film Festival. Following the meeting, McGowan told Messick what had happened, but did not use the word \"rape.\" Despite this, Messick recognized that something untoward had happened and immediately went to her bosses to recount McGowan's story. They told her that they would handle the situation, and the arrangements between McGowan and Weinstein were then negotiated without Messick's knowledge.\n\nTen months later, Messick was hired by Miramax as an executive at Miramax Films working in production in Los Angeles. However, in recent months, McGowan's constant press attention has led to Weinstein releasing documents, including an email that Messick wrote to him months prior to the first New York Times piece coming out. In this email, Messick offered the truth based on what she remembered McGowan telling her about the Sundance account.\n\nMessick's family said that seeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person's attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Weinstein's attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her.

The intense emotions, confusion, and behaviors of the show's characters can be disturbing to any viewer, especially younger viewers who are still developing their brain executive functions. The show may also be interpreted by young viewers as normal adolescent behavior, leading to a misunderstanding of the seriousness of teen suicide.\n\nFurthermore, the show neglects to address the primary reason for the main character's suicide, which is depression. The show presents a harsh and untrue message that Hannah's classmates actually caused her death. The missed opportunity to describe how depression feels and how it looks to others is the show's greatest failure.\n\nAs a parent, it's important to discuss the themes of the show with your child and help them process it in a healthy way.

Dauriac, on the other hand, believed that the child should be raised in France, and argued that Johansson's busy work schedule makes it impossible for her to have primary custody.\n\nDespite the drama, Johansson maintained that she would never comment on the dissolution of her marriage, and asked other parties involved and the media to do the same, out of respect for her desires as a parent and for all working moms.\n\nThe actress, who has recently been linked with Saturday Night Live star Colin Jost and her attorney, Kevin Yorn, tied the knot with Dauriac in a private wedding ceremony in 2014.

An insider close to the prince revealed that Harry had always smoked socially, but as he doesn't go out as much anymore, he naturally lost interest in smoking.\n\nIn addition to his newfound dedication to fitness, Harry has also been working closely with a personal trainer to get into the best shape of his life. The source added that Harry was already in good shape when he met Meghan, but the two of them enjoy healthy living together. They eat sensibly, Harry's diet is very clean, and ahead of the wedding, he is working out five times a week.\n\nMeghan, on the other hand, focuses mostly on yoga and occasionally goes to the gym. While she may not be as intense as Harry's workout routine, she is still committed to staying fit and healthy. As the two count down the days until their special day, it's clear that they are both putting in the work to make sure this day is everything they've always dreamed of.",

        "content": "As the anticipation for the highly anticipated Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald movie grows, fans are eagerly waiting to see how Jude Law will bring the iconic character of Albus Dumbledore to life. With the first film's success and the recent announcement that Law would be taking over the role, the news was met with excitement and skepticism alike. However, subsequent photos and a trailer of Law as Dumbledore have only reinforced the idea that Law was the perfect choice for the role. In this interview, Law reveals how his portrayal of Dumbledore differs from previous actors, discusses the author J.K. Rowling's input on the character, and shares some intriguing plot details.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So before you took on this role, what research did you do, if any?\n\nJUDE LAW: I knew the books and the Harry Potter films pretty well, my children grew up with them so I grew up as an accompanying adult. And I’d seen and enjoyed the first [Fantastic Beasts] film. Then I had the good fortune and opportunity to sit with [author and screenwriter] J.K. Rowling shortly after we started work on it. She gave me a very good sense of Albus?life journey and who he was and what was happening in his head and his heart and his world for this particular story.\n\nDid you look at the performances of previous Dumbledore actors Richard Harris and Michael Gambon?\n\nI’m sure they were in the back of my mind, because I’d seen their work and admired both of them as actors, greatly. I talked with [director] David Yates about that and we both decided that it wasn’t necessary to do an impersonation of one of them as a younger man. This is a man with almost 100 years ahead of him before he became that character so we wanted to look at who he was in this moment and construct our own version. It makes me laugh when he’s called “Young Albus?because I’m 45, so I’m more in the middle of a midlife crisis, but I’m happy to hold onto that as long as I can!\n\nI found it funny you went from playing the Young Pope to Young Albus in pop culture.\n\nThe word “Young?has to be in every part I play, it’s contractual.\n\nWhat did Rowling say in terms of the performance or interior life of the character that you found helpful?\n\nWell gosh, there was so much reference to interior life. The one thing that came out was the sense of play. He has a youthful mercurial approach to life, but that there’s something that hangs heavy in his heart, in his past, that underlies all of that. There’s a root of good humor and good heart and sense of self and a sense of past.\n\nHow much say, if any, did you have on how he looks in the film?\n\nWhen you hire [famed costume designer] Colleen Atwood, you know you’re in the hands of someone rather great. There’s no one quite like her in the world of film. She has a very clear vision. It was open and collaborative, there were tweaks here and there, but I was happily corralled into the overall look which was clear from the get-go.\n\nSo what’s Dumbledore like at this age and how different is he than how we know him?\n\nAs I mentioned before, there’s a sense of humor and mischief, a dash of anarchy, a sense of what’s right and what he believes in, and a sense of mystery. There’s also how he comes around to get people onto his way of thinking ?which is rather indirectly. He also has a certain heaviness about him that I don’t want to reveal too much about ?and that’s something he has to overcome, or hopes to overcome. He’s also got a great passion for sharing his knowledge, he’s a powerful and inclusive teacher.\n\nSo he teaches Transfiguration, right?\n\nHe doesn’t teach Transfiguration, actually, not at this stage.\n\nOh! Because in Potter lore, it was said he used to be a Transfiguration teacher before becoming headmaster…\n\nAt this stage in his career, he’s not. I’m not sure I’m allowed to say what he teaches…[Editor’s note: We think we may have figured it out]\n\nAh, okay. Well, what was your favorite spell to cast?\n\nWell ?I ah ?I only get to cast one. There’s a lot you don’t know about Albus in this film. And there are certain restrictions in storytelling ?you’ll see, it all makes sense. You don’t see him in full flow yet.\n\nInteresting! And if I remember right, Dumbledore doesn’t yet have the infamous Elder Wand, right? So what’s his current wand like?\n\nAlbus doesn’t have the Elder Wand yet, no. I have a wand. It’s very reflective of him, beautiful dark wood root with a stone on one end.\n\nHe calls on Newt to go after Grindelwald. What’s his relationship with his former student?\n\nI think he admires in Newt this sense of moral code that he will always do the right thing because he can’t do anything but the right thing. I think he likes that Newt finds beauty in beasts because I think occasionally Dumbledore feels like a beast. And there’s a master and mentee kind of relationship. And Newt isn’t afraid to say when he thinks Dumbledore is wrong, it’s not servitude.\n\nThere was some uproar earlier this year when director David Yates told EW the character not “explicitly gay?in this film. What’s your take on how apparent Dumbledore’s sexuality should be?\n\nJo Rowling revealed some years back that Dumbledore was gay. That was a question I actually asked Jo and she said, yes, he’s gay. But as with humans, your sexuality doesn’t necessarily define you; he’s multifaceted. I suppose the question is: How is Dumbledore’s sexuality depicted in this film? What you got to remember this is only the second Fantastic Beasts film in a series and what’s brilliant about Jo’s writing is how she reveals her characters, peels them to the heart over time. You’re just getting to know Albus in this film, and there’s obviously a lot more to come. We learn a little about his past in the beginning of this film, and characters and their relationships will unfold naturally which I’m excited to reveal. But we’re not going to reveal everything all at once.\n\nObviously, Dumbledore had a relationship with Grindelwald. What’s that relationship like at this point in time? And what was it like working with Johnny Depp?\n\nI don’t actually have any scenes with Johnny. As I said before, this is only Part 2 of a longer story. I’ve always admired him from afar, but we don’t know each other, and I’ve not yet met him on this. In many ways that suits the relationship as it’s been many years since they’ve seen each other. So there’s complexity in that that’s fun to mine. Again, the past will reveal itself.\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald opens Nov. 16.]",

The creator-executive producer, Amy Sherman-Palladino, had been pushing Amazon executives for a pickup since she accepted the Peabody Award for the show's freshman season on Saturday night.\n\nSherman-Palladino was over the moon as she accepted the prestigious award for her show, which stars Rachel Brosnahan as an Upper West Side housewife who ventures into standup comedy after her picture-perfect marriage falls apart. \"You're going to give it to us because we're bringing home the fancy thing, right?\" she said to Amazon executives, hinting that they would be renewing the show for a third season.\n\nAnd they did!

The first two seasons, which were ordered by the previous Amazon regime with a two-season commitment spread across 18 episodes, will be followed by a third season that is likely to have 10 installments.\n\nSeason 1 of \"Mrs. Maisel\" premiered in late November and season 2 is set to premiere later this year.

It’s karma!!\"\n\nHowever, Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen took exception to Shelton's tweet, accusing him of cheating on his wife while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006. Allen deleted a tweet calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert, stating, \"You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up.\"\n\nAllen further stated to RadarOnline.com that he did not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert, who he described as a \"loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.\" He added that he did not believe Lambert cheated on him, but he was not surprised by Shelton's tweet.\n\nIt was previously reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair, but both singers have denied this. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. However, they announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.\n\nLambert recently ended her two-year relationship with Anderson East, while Shelton recently ended his two-year relationship with Anderson East.

Felker was previously married to global strategist Staci Nelson, but the couple divorced in September 2016.

Kim Kardashian Meets President Trump and Gets Results for Inmate Alice Marie Johnson - See What She Had to Say!\n\nKim Kardashian caused a stir when she appeared at the White House to meet with President Donald Trump earlier this week. The reality star was positively starstruck as she walked into the Oval Office to lobby for executive clemency for Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old Alabama inmate who was serving life without parole for a first-time, non-violent drug offense.\n\nKardashian's meeting with Trump led to a mixed bag of reactions, with some mocking it as a summit between two reality stars, while others praised the mother of three for making a successful push for meaningful social justice. Trump granted Johnson clemency and she was released on Wednesday, a goal Kardashian had been working towards for seven months.\n\n\"I saw this seven months ago and I have [had] daily phone calls with the White House, maybe a dozen emails a day trying to get letters from the warden,\" Kardashian told CNN Tonight with Don Lemon. \"I have to get credit to where Alice’s whole team had been working on this for years. I mean, I did step in late in the game. So I don’t want to take away from [that].”\n\nKardashian said she was positively floored to find herself in the White House lobbying for something so weighty. \"I never get starstruck,\" she admitted to Jones. \"I was starstruck over the Oval Office... It really felt powerful, and felt like, you can just feel the history in there... I just took a second to take it all in, and then we talked about it.”\n\nShe said Trump was compassionate and sympathetic during their meeting. \"He said, 'You know, this is a really long time that she’s been in here, right? This just isn’t fair,'\" Kardashian recalled. \"He knew that this is the right thing to do, and he said that from the start after he had heard her whole story and situation and he knew it was the right thing to do... And he wanted to make it happen.”\n\nJones asked Kardashian about some celebrities' unwillingness to visit the Trump White House and the possibility that she was being used as a pawn for political game. The reality star answered by saying that she respects celebrity refusals and recognizes the optics of her meeting with Trump. But she said the results were what mattered most.\n\n\"I think Kanye’s already given him legitimacy... you know, in that way,\" she added of husband Kanye West's public support of the controversial commander in chief. \"I don’t think I would be used... And, at the end of the day, he heard me out. We got the job done.\"\n\n\"I just have to stay focused, and I have to know that if [he] is the only person in the world that could have done this for her, why wouldn’t I go talk to that person, if I had the opportunity to? Forget about my fears. Forget about my life. That was the right thing to do,\" she continued. \"I mean, there’s over 3,000 people in this same exact situation as Alice...

The actor’s representative exclusively confirmed the news to CNN.\n\nFranco, 39, is nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for his role in The Disaster Artist. Earlier this month, he won Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe Awards for his portrayal of Tommy Wiseau in the cult film’s making.\n\nHowever, Franco faced backlash earlier this month when several women accused him of inappropriate behavior at the Golden Globes. Many A-list attendees wore black in solidarity with the Time’s Up movement, which raises money to fight sexual harassment, assault, and inequality in the workplace. Franco, however, wore a Time’s Up pin on his lapel.\n\nJust a few days later, the Los Angeles Times published a report in which five women claimed that Franco had behaved inappropriately with them. Four of the women were former students at his film school, Studio 4, in Hollywood. One woman, aspiring filmmaker Violet Paley, alleged that Franco pressured her into performing oral sex on him in her car.\n\nFranco’s attorney disputed the allegations, while the actor himself addressed the Twitter claims during a January 9 appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\n\n“The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn’t have a voice for so long,?he said. “So, I don’t want to shut them down in any way. It’s, I think, a good thing and I support it.”\n\nWill Franco’s presence at the SAG Awards be a brave stance against the allegations, or a publicity stunt? Stay tuned to find out!",

The couple, who met on the set of the E! reality show Total Divas, have been chronicling their journey together on the show.\n\n\"Where we were 10 years ago is a world apart from where we are now,\" Naomi said. \"We were younger, more immature, and life was different. Our careers have taken off, we've gotten married, and we're now homeowners. I'm now a hands-on stepmom to my stepkids, which I love.\"\n\nDespite their success, Naomi admits that the cameras can be tough. \"Everything that comes with our lifestyle isn't always easy, and we're trying to figure out how to balance our wants and needs,\" she said. \"We're learning about each other and our marriage, and hopefully, our show can help other couples going through similar struggles.\"\n\nNaomi is also proud of the progress she's made in her career. In 2017, she became the first African-American SmackDown women's champion, and this year, she participated in the inaugural women's Royal Rumble and won the first-ever women's battle royal at WrestleMania. She hopes that WWE will continue to push for female empowerment, and she's proud to be part of that movement.\n\nOutside of her personal life, Naomi is excited for Survivor Series, where she will team up with Asuka against Team Raw. She hopes that they'll be the first to hold the tag team titles, and she's been learning a lot from her talented tag partner.\n\n\"I think where things stand right now, you're seeing a different side of her,\" Naomi said of Asuka. \"She is truly talented, and I've been learning so much from her.

She called Spears \"trailer trash\" and was in utter disbelief that she had bought her own diamond rock. In a December 2003 interview with Blender magazine, Aguilera called Spears \"distant\" during rehearsals for their MTV Video Music Awards performance with Madonna. Spears subsequently slammed Aguilera in the January 2004 issue of Blender, claiming that Aguilera had tried to put her tongue down her throat in a club in front of all those people.

On one side, liberals yearn for a big hug and a demand that Trump be held accountable for his Russia ties and impeached. On the other side, Trump's base desires legitimacy and the belief that they are right. However, viewers will be disappointed to know that neither group will get what they want from the first episode of the season.\n\nAs \"Election Night\" begins, we meet two avatars of the left and the right in a small town in Michigan. Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) is a liberal lesbian who feels attacked and sees her family being torn apart by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, Kai Anderson (Evan Peters) is a blue-haired do-nothing who wants to use the chaos of Trump's presidency to cull the weak from the herd. However, both characters are not right. Ally is portrayed as an unhinged woman who lets politics ruin her life, and she committed an unspeakable act by voting for Jill Stein.\n\nAlly's descent into madness is terrifying, and she is haunted by more and more phobias. Paulson's performance is perfect, and Ally is clearly struggling with more than her fair share of problems. The twisty clown, Twisty the Clown, returns to slay another couple, but it is later revealed that he exists only in a comic book that Ozzy got his hands on. The Insane Clown Posse is also stalking Ally, but it is unclear whether they are real or just in her head.\n\nAlly's relationship with her nanny, Winter, is also strange, and it seems that they may be in the season's cult, which worships Twisty the Clown. Winter lost a bet around the election, and she must work for Kai to bring about a new world order where everyone lives in fear all the time. It is unclear how Ally fits into this theory, but she has certainly seen her fair share of horror this past year.\n\nIn conclusion, American Horror Story: Cult has failed to deliver what many Americans want in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election. The first episode of the season is a disappointment, and viewers will be left wanting more.",

Therefore, I would predict its veracity as 1.",
