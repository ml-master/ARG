When asked about Jennifer Lopez, she responded by saying, \"I don't know her.\" This statement led to a meme and a feud that has been widely debated.\n\nAndy Cohen was the first to directly ask Jennifer Lopez about the feud in 2014.

Lopez stated that she was not aware of any past incidents and believed that the feud was largely the result of word of mouth.\n\nLast year, Mariah Carey was interviewed by The Cut and discussed gifts she received from her fans. She mentioned a fan-made shirt with a quote that she had made years ago, which was taken out of context and blown out of proportion.\n\nThe feud was reignited after Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey's performance at the Billboard Music Awards. Lopez responded to this incident by saying that she had watched most of Carey's performance and was only briefly distracted.\n\nLopez has recently been promoting her numerous projects, including Shades of Blue and American Idol. During a visit to Watch What Happens Live, she addressed the feud again, stating that it was not fair to criticize her for looking down for one second during Carey's performance.\n\nLopez also appeared on The Wendy Williams Show where she was asked about Mariah Carey. When Williams joked about Carey's statement that she did not know Lopez, Lopez responded by saying, \"She does say that. She's forgetful I guess.\"",

Just like his mom, Meghan, Guy has been on an incredible journey.\n\nBefore Meghan adopted him in 2015, he was on the verge of being put down by a shelter in Kentucky. But thanks to Dolores Doherty and her rescue charity A Dog's Dream Rescue, Guy was given a second chance. Doherty brought him to an adoption event just outside Toronto, where Meghan was living while filming Suits. Little did they know, Meghan was one of the hopeful dog owners.\n\nGuy's journey didn't end there. After traveling 500 miles to the border, Doherty brought him to an adoption event, where Meghan finally adopted him. Meghan's other dog, Bogart, couldn't make the trip across the pond due to his age, but Guy has now moved to London with Meghan, a Kensington Palace rep confirmed in November.\n\nMeghan's love of dogs is something she shares with her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, who is known to be very fond of corgis. Just last month, the Queen's last corgi, Willow, passed away at the age of 14. Perhaps hanging out with her new four-legged friend, Guy, has helped fill that hole.\n\nMeghan and Guy's bond is obvious, and it's clear that they have a special connection.

Harry, Meghan's fiancé, recalled in their first interview together, \"For 33 years, I’ve been barked at, and this one walks in, and absolutely nothing, just wagging tails.\"\n\nTomorrow, Guy will be by Meghan's side again as they walk down the aisle in one of the most important moments of their lives. Here's to hoping that they'll carpool to the wedding together, and that their love for each other will continue to grow.",

The PTC's President, Tim Winter, stated that the results of the study should serve as a wake-up call for parents concerned about graphic or indecent material on websites they perceive as safe for their children. The report concluded that YouTube is not doing enough to protect children from inappropriate material, as its gating procedures do not extend to text commentary, and that many popular search terms produce videos linked to ads for triple-X pornography without requiring age verification. The PTC has previously commended YouTube for its commitment to gating procedures and its plans to curb inappropriate content.",

It's still one of the most fun things I've ever done.

I felt weak at the knees and I was overwhelmed with how I felt, but then it took me about 10 months to get the courage up to actually do anything about it.\"\n\nDeGeneres announced her plans to marry de Rossi in a 2008 episode of her talk show, following the news that the California Supreme Court had struck down a law banning same-sex marriage.

Prince Harry has reportedly entrusted his brother Prince William and his best friend Tom Inskip to plan the event.\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair, Tom Inskip has been scouting out possible venues for the bachelor party, with a \"suitably swanky boutique hotel in Mexico\" being a top choice. However, earlier reports indicated that the party could be held at a Swiss ski resort of Verbier, with Prince Andrew offering his ski chalet to hold the event.\n\nGiven that Prince Harry has become more restrained since meeting Meghan Markle, it is unlikely that the bachelor party will be as raucous as some of the parties he has attended in the past. Prince Harry is also said to be smoking less and drinking less, which could also affect the tone of the party.\n\nOverall, the public is eagerly awaiting details about Prince Harry's bachelor party, and speculation is rife about where and when the event will take place.",

Despite a massive fan campaign, Netflix has decided to revive the show for a fourth season, leaving many to wonder why such a beloved series was cancelled in the first place.\n\n\"Lucifer\" never really set the ratings afire, but it had a dedicated fan base that fought hard to keep the show alive.

Creator Joe Henderson tweeted out that the axing \"fucking hurts,\" and star Tom Ellis tweeted that he was \"gutted\" by the cancellation.\n\nAs Netflix picks up the show, it is clear that the Peak TV era offers more choices where one outlet's miss is another's hit. It also is worth noting that Netflix didn't even have the SVOD rights to \"Lucifer\" - Hulu did - meaning that deal had to be reworked, similar to the way Amazon recently revived Syfy's \"The Expanse\" after having to renegotiate SVOD rights as the first three seasons were sold to Netflix.\n\nThis cancellation comes as Fox undergoes a dramatic shift amid its studio counterpart's pending sale to Disney (or Comcast). Gone are niche comedies like \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" and narrow dramas like \"Lucifer,\" as Fox plots a shift to broader audiences with a slate of procedurals and multicamera comedies. It is clear that the cancellation of \"Lucifer\" is a reflection of these changes, leaving many to wonder what the future holds for this beloved series and its dedicated fan base.",

In a blog post published by her radio station KABC, Tweeden detailed her encounter with Franken backstage before a show.\n\nAccording to Tweeden, Franken had written a skit for the show and brought props and costumes to accompany it. The skit featured Tweeden and a kiss, which she felt was unnecessary and made her uncomfortable. Tweeden writes that Franken repeatedly insisted they rehearse the kiss, despite her protests. When they finally did the line leading up to the kiss, Franken came at her aggressively and placed his hand on her head, mashing his lips against hers and sticking his tongue in her mouth. Tweeden writes that she pushed him away and felt violated and humiliated.\n\nTweeden also alleges that Franken groped her without her consent while she was asleep on the tour's journey home. She writes that she found a photo of Franken putting his hands on her breasts while she slept.\n\nFranken released a statement shortly after the accusations, apologizing to Tweeden and others involved in the tour, as well as to everyone who works for him and counts on him as an ally and champion of women. He stated that he respects women and does not respect men who do not, and that he will cooperate with an ethics investigation.\n\nTweeden's allegations come amid a growing wave of sexual misconduct scandals in Hollywood and beyond. In 2017, the New York Times and the New Yorker published investigative pieces accusing movie producer Harvey Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Other celebrities have since come forward with their own accounts of sexual misconduct.",

There are also rumors that she has ordered her security to delete a fan's camera photos and that she has been distant and snubbed fans at meet and greets.\n\nWhile some of these rumors may have some basis in truth, it is important to approach them with a critical eye and to not jump to conclusions without all the facts. It is also important to remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinions and behavior, and it is unfair to judge someone based on hearsay or gossip.",

It's unclear if the couple has worked through their issues and reconciled, but one thing is certain - Sean and Aiko's love story has left many fans hearts aflutter and hearts heavy with sadness.",

However, in light of the allegations made by Rapp, the Academy has decided to revoke its honor.\n\nRapp, who was just 14 years old at the time of the alleged incident, recently came forward with his story, describing how Spacey had made a sexual advance on him at a party. Spacey, who apologized for his \"deeply inappropriate drunken behavior\" in a tweet, has maintained that he doesn't remember the incident.\n\nDespite his apology, the producers of his Netflix show, \"House of Cards,\" announced that they were suspending production on season six. The decision to end the show after season six was made before the scandal broke. The producers also noted that they were meeting with the cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported.\n\nThis is a difficult time for all involved, and our hearts go out to anyone who has been affected by sexual assault.

However, his battle with addiction led him to take drastic steps.\n\nThe former Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman's death was ruled an apparent suicide, but Vicky Cornell and others argue that there is more to the story. Medical reports found seven different drugs in his system, but these were not a contributing factor to his death.\n\nDr. Richard Cote, the chair of the department of pathology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, conducted an independent analysis of Chris Cornell's autopsy and revealed that two drugs found in his system may have resulted in impaired judgment and motor functions.\n\nVicky Cornell also revealed that her husband fell back into addiction approximately a year before his death, after being sober since 2003. He took 20-something pills in a week and 33 pills in nine days.\n\nThe new drugs changed him, she said, and his brain became different from that of someone who doesn't have a substance use disorder. He relapsed, and just two months later, he walked off stage in the middle of what would turn out to be his final performance and died hours later in his hotel room.\n\nVicky Cornell said explaining what happened to her children the following day was \"the most tragic thing you can ever go through.\" She added that she is now making it her mission to raise awareness and destigmatize addiction, and encourage others to speak openly about the topic.\n\n“People think that addiction is like, ‘Oh, you were an addict,'” she said. “People don’t recognize it as a disease.”\n\n“You think addiction is a choice, and it's not,” she added. “I think that if there was less stigma around it, more people would speak up.”\n\nShe added that addiction has now \"crossed over all sorts of socioeconomic boundaries ... it's everywhere.\"\n\n“My husband was the furthest thing from a rock star junkie. He just wasn't,\" she said. \"He was the best husband, the greatest father. I lost my soulmate and the love of my life.”",

It has been reported that Kevin Bacon expressed support for President Trump in an interview with ABC's \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos.\" However, this claim is not accurate.\n\nA recent article on the fake news website Worldwide Politics purported to summarize a supposed interview with Kevin Bacon on \"This Week.\" In this supposed interview, Bacon reportedly stated, \"I honestly think that we are blessed to have him as President – he is the only one who can take care of all this mess.\" However, Kevin Bacon has not appeared on \"This Week\" since 2007 and did not express support for President Trump during that time.\n\nKevin Bacon's political history does not suggest that he would have publicly endorsed President Trump. In 2007, he campaigned for John Edwards and later donated to Barack Obama. While some Obama voters may have shifted to Trump in 2016, there is little evidence to suggest that Kevin Bacon did so himself.\n\nIt is worth noting that Worldwide Politics is not the only fake news site that spreads false celebrity news. The Daily News for Americans also published a made-up story claiming that actress Julia Roberts called President Trump \"the best president in US history\" during the Women's March in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to be cautious of news that may be false or biased. In this case, the Kevin Bacon story appears to be a product of misinformation and should be treated as such.",

You get warning signs, and then you realize that you are not a tank, as (my wife) Ali says. Edge has this thing that he says about me, that I look upon my body as an inconvenience.\"\n\nWhile he does not want to discuss the details of his near-death experience, Bono acknowledges that it was a physical event that had a profound impact on him. \"It's just a thing that ... people have these extinction events in their lives; it could be psychological or it could be physical,\" he says. \"And, yes, it was physical for me, but I think I have spared myself all that soap opera.\"\n\nBono also reveals that his health scare was not the first time he has faced a life-threatening situation. In 2000, doctors wanted to biopsy him for throat cancer, but luckily everything turned out to be fine. He also broke his arm in a bicycle accident in 2014, which he calls a \"comic tragedy.\"\n\nDespite these close calls, Bono says that he has learned to keep some aspects of his life private. \"Especially with this kind of celebrity obsession with the minutiae of peoples' lives – I have got out of that,\" he says. \"I want to speak about the issue in a way that lets people fill in the blanks of what they have been through, you know? It's one thing if you were talking about it in a place of record like Rolling Stone, but by the time it gets to your local tabloid it is just awful. It becomes the question that everyone is asking.\"\n\nUltimately, Bono says that his near-death experience has made him more aware of his own mortality and has inspired him to write about it in his music. \"Strangely enough, mortality was going to be a subject anyway just because it is a subject not often covered,\" he says. \"And you can't write 'Songs of Experience' without writing about that. And I've had a couple of these shocks to the system, let's call them, in my life. Like my bike accident or my back injury. So it was always going to be the subject.

It is not clear why the tabloid made this claim, as there is no evidence to support it.",

His daughter, Mikaela, a shining star in her own right, has proven that she has inherited her father's love of music and his star quality. A video of the 6-year-old dancing to her father's hit song \"Echame La Culpa\" has touched the hearts of millions on social media.\n\nThe video, posted by Fonsi's wife, Agueda López, while vacationing in the Dominican Republic, shows Mikaela and a group of young friends doing choreographed moves to the beat of her father's smash duet with Demi Lovato while in their bathing suits by the pool. The caption, \"Hey Fonsi!!! #NewDancers #FonsisGirls #TooMuch#EchameLaCulpa,\" reads like a love letter to the father who adores his daughter.\n\nAfter a busy 2017, which included a European tour, Fonsi took a well-deserved break with his family in the Caribbean. He offered fans a glimpse of a tropical paradise where he relaxed and watched his kids play, while working only on his tan. The singer's holiday included male bonding during tee time, with images of him, his brother, his dad, and his brother-in-law playing golf in Cap Cana.\n\nFonsi, who is a proud father of two, has admitted that his crazy work schedule has kept him away from home in Miami more than he would like. He told PEOPLE CHICA last year that he loves his family so much and this year, with all the traveling it's been really challenging to be apart from them. That's why when he is home or they come to where he is at that time, he tries to just enjoy every minute.\n\nThe singer's love for his children is clear in his words. \"I love playing with them, taking my daughter to school, watching movies, and [I] hug them to the point they can't stand me anymore,\" he joked. \"Everything I do is for them, they are my light and I can't believe how lucky I am to have them in my life.\"",

Some fans believe the imagery is a metaphor for her own \"sexual liberation,\" but others think otherwise.\n\nThere have also been reports that Perry is part of a cannibalistic cult filled with other high-profile celebrities. One theory suggests that she has unaccounted for Twitter followers because she is part of a larger, more cannibalistic group.\n\nWhile these theories may be entertaining, it is important to approach them with a critical eye and not jump to conclusions without evidence.",

        "content": "The meteoric rise of Donald Trump and his seemingly unbeatable political prowess have left many experts stumped, seeking an explanation as to how this occurred. To fully understand this phenomenon, we must not only examine Trump himself, but also his devoted supporters, whose unwavering admiration and devotion to their unpredictable and often inflammatory leader baffles many.\n\nPsychologists and neuroscientists have provided numerous thought-provoking explanations for Trump's enduring support, but the accounts of these experts often vary greatly, sometimes overlapping and other times conflicting. However insightful these critiques may be, it is clear that further research and examination are needed to pinpoint the exact psychological and social factors driving this bizarre behavior.\n\nIn a recent review paper published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, UC Santa Cruz professor Thomas Pettigrew argues that five major psychological phenomena can help explain this exceptional political event.\n\n1. Authoritarianism: This refers to the advocacy or enforcement of strict obedience to authority, often at the expense of personal freedom. Those with authoritarian personality syndrome, a prevalent condition, often display aggression toward outgroup members, submissiveness to authority, resistance to new experiences, and a rigid hierarchical view of society. Trump's speeches, with their absolutist terms like \"losers\" and \"disasters,\" naturally appeal to those who prefer authoritarianism. Research has shown that Republican voters scored higher on measures of authoritarianism before Trump's rise, and a 2016 survey found that high authoritarians greatly favored Trump, leading to his election win.\n\n2. Social dominance orientation (SDO): This refers to people who prefer a societal hierarchy where high-status groups have dominance over low-status ones. Those with SDO are typically dominant, tough-minded, and driven by self-interest. Trump appeals to those with SDO by making clear distinctions between high-status groups (White) and low-status groups (immigrants and minorities). A survey found that those who scored high on both SDO and authoritarianism were those who intended to vote for Trump.\n\n3. Prejudice: While not all Trump supporters are prejudiced against ethnic and religious minorities, some certainly are. The Republican party has long used strategies that appeal to bigotry, such as \"dog whistles\" that signal prejudice to racists but not to others. Trump's shockingly direct appeals to bigoted supporters, such as calling Muslims \"dangerous\" and Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers,\" likely play a role in his popularity. A new study shows that support for Trump is correlated with a standard scale of modern racism.\n\n4. Intergroup contact: Contact with members of groups outside one's own has been shown to reduce prejudice. However, Trump's white supporters have experienced significantly less contact with minorities than other Americans. A study found that the racial and ethnic isolation of Whites at the zip-code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support, and this correlation persisted while controlling for dozens of other variables. Support for Trump increased with voters' physical distance from the Mexican border.\n\n5. Relative deprivation: This refers to the experience of feeling deprived of something one believes they are entitled to. Trump supporters who feel that American jobs are being lost to Mexico and China may be experiencing relative deprivation, particularly in swing states like Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This kind of deprivation is based on a skewed perception of entitlement, rather than an absolute lack of resources.\n\nThese psychological phenomena help explain the peculiar behavior of Trump's supporters, but further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.",

However, one guest who is noticeably absent from the list is Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister. Speculation is rife as to why she was left off the guest list for Harry and Meghan's wedding reception.\n\nPippa's wedding to James Matthews in May 2017 was attended by the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, but Meghan did not make an appearance at the ceremony. Despite claims that Meghan was present at the reception, no images have emerged to support this.\n\nIn the build-up to the wedding, there were reports that Meghan was advised not to wear anything similar to Pippa or Kate to avoid upstaging them. However, Meghan did not attend the ceremony.\n\nPippa and Meghan are rarely seen together, which has led some to speculate that they may be trying to avoid each other on the wedding day. Dr. Nyla Raja, a cosmetic dermatology GP and founder of Wilmslow Medispa, Manchester, believes that there may be similarities in their facial features, such as a similar eye shape, high cheekbones, and differences in lip size and jawline.\n\nHarry and Meghan have not revealed the guest list for their wedding reception, but it is expected to be significantly smaller than Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding at Westminster Abbey. The couple's closest friends, family, and celebrities, such as the Beckhams, Millie Mackintosh, and tennis star Serena Williams, are expected to attend.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Meghan reportedly attended a friend's wedding in Jamaica this weekend.

The actress and comedian, who was recently fired from her ABC show and talent agency, claimed that she was under the influence of the medication when she made the tweet that sparked outrage.\n\nBarr first made the excuse in a series of tweets on Tuesday, saying that she was \"ambien tweeting\" at 2am and that she had done \"weird stuff while on ambien - cracked eggs on the wall at 2am etc.\" She later added, \"guys I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me.\"\n\nBut her excuse didn't sit well with people, who pointed out that she had previously tweeted racist things and that she had been fired from her show for making a racist tweet. Late-night hosts latched onto her excuse, joking that racism might be a side effect of Ambien in spoof ads.\n\nThe manufacturer of Ambien, Sanofi U.S., responded to the comments, saying that racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.\n\nOn Comedy Central, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah joked, \"If you listen to their ads, there is a subtle warning about just [racism].\"\n\nIn related news, Roseanne Barr has been fired from her ABC show and talent agency after she made a racist tweet. The tweet caused a firestorm and led to her being fired from the show and the talent agency.\n\nBarr's excuse for her racist tweet has been met with widespread criticism, and she has been called out for her previous racist tweets. It's unclear if she will be able to return to the show or the talent agency.\n\nIn a statement, ABC said, \"Roseanne Barr's tweets about race are reprehensible and have no place on our air or anywhere else. We have terminated our agreement with her.\"\n\nTrevor Noah joked on his show that if Ambien is taken on Memorial Day, racist side effects are amplified. He also pointed out that if you've ever asked when there will be a White History Month, used the phrase \"I'm not racist, but...\" or previously tweeted racist things that your boss forgot about, then Ambien might be for you.\n\nOn Full Frontal, a fake ad for the drug showed images of individuals struggling to fall asleep with a voiceover narration stating, \"If sleeping through the night feels like a far away dream, try Ambien, the prescription sleep aid that helps you get a good night's sleep and possibly makes you racist?\"\n\nThe ad goes on to state that users should use Ambien if \"you've ever asked when will there be a White History Month,\" used the phrase \"I'm not racist, but...\" and \"if you've previously tweeted racist things that your boss forgot about.\" The latter statement was accompanied by an old tweet by Barr.\n\nOverall, the backlash against Barr's racist tweet and her excuse for it has been swift and severe. It's unclear if she will be able to return to the show or the talent agency, and she has been called out for her previous racist tweets.",

However, it appeared that she skipped over another co-star, Reese Witherspoon, who was also a nominee.\n\nThis gesture has led to speculation that there might be a rift between the actresses. However, it is more likely that the broadcast simply did not show the embrace between Dern and Witherspoon. It is also possible that Dern was just gripping the seat in front of her as she was getting up, which would explain her absence from the hug.\n\nDespite the apparent snub, Dern did give a shoutout to Witherspoon in her acceptance speech, mentioning her as part of her \"tribe\" of four co-stars. This suggests that there is no bad blood between the actresses. It is also worth noting that the chairs on the stage can be in the way, making it difficult to give a hug to someone who is sitting directly in front of you.\n\nOverall, it seems that the absence from the hug was an oversight and not intentional.",

The judge emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy and strong relationship between the children and their parents, stating that \"not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them.\" The judge has also ordered Jolie to provide her children with cellphones that allow Pitt to call them at any time, without Jolie monitoring, and to refrain from reading their text messages with their father.\n\nThe court has outlined a summer schedule for the children, except for Maddox, who is old enough to decide how much time he wants to spend with Pitt. Pitt will have custody of the children from June 8 to June 17, for four hours per day, while he stays in London, where Jolie is renting a house. He will designate one or two minor children to spend time with at a time and will also spend time with each child at least twice during this 10-day period. Jolie will not be present during or interfere with Pitt's custodial time.\n\nPitt will also have custody of the children from July 8 to July 14, when a doctor will be required to be present and will meet with the children before and after each two-day period. From July 21 to July 29, Pitt will resume custody of the children when he returns to California. The court noted that if the minor children remain closed off to their father, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with Jolie and may lead to primary physical custody being ordered in Pitt's favor.\n\nJolie's spokesperson has expressed disappointment at the release of confidential court records, stating that it is not in the best interests of the children. The spokesperson emphasized that Jolie has been focused on the children's health and needs throughout the divorce.",

However, the devastating truth was revealed to be something entirely different.\n\nIn a poignant storyline, we were given a glimpse into two defining moments in Jack's life: the day he met his wife Rebecca and the day he irreparably damaged their relationship. The first revealed Jack to be a hardworking handyman and mechanic, saving money and dreaming of a better future. He finally won a large poker game, but was robbed and assaulted by his competitors. In a fit of rage, Jack decides to plot his revenge by stealing money from the cash register of the men who attacked him. Instead, he falls in love with Rebecca, a love that would ultimately lead to heartbreak.\n\nIn the second, heart-wrenching storyline, Jack is devastated by his wife's decision to go on tour for weeks on end. He is so angry and hurt that he gets drunk on his way to her performance and continues to drink even when he arrives. As viewers know, Jack has struggled with alcoholism, a struggle that he tried to overcome when his children were young.\n\nDespite his drunken behavior, Jack finds himself kicked out of Rebecca's performance and forced to drive home. When they arrive, Rebecca demands to know what Jack loves about her in that moment, not in the past. In a heart-wrenching moment, Jack professes his love for her as a mother, as a woman who is still beautiful, who still makes him laugh, who still dances with all his heart, and who is still the same woman who ran out of a blind date all those years ago because she had to sing.\n\nHowever, even with this passionate declaration of love, Jack leaves the Pearson household as a symbol of his penance for his terrible behavior, leaving his wife and children heartbroken in his wake.",

Hollywood's least serious award show is set to kick off the awards season, and while it may not hold the same weight as the Oscars, it often foreshadows the direction that the industry is heading in. Hosting the show this year is none other than Seth Meyers, who you may recognize from his NBC late-night show, \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\"\n\nThis will be Meyers' first time hosting the Golden Globes, but he's not exactly a stranger to talk show hosting. He'll be following in the footsteps of Jimmy Fallon, who hosted last year. NBC is marketing the show under the tagline \"Hollywood, we have a lot to talk about,\" so expect lots of humor and not-at-all uncomfortable and awkward moments about the recent turmoil in Hollywood over sexual harassment and abuse.\n\nMeyers spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about taking on the gig, revealing that he discussed it with his wife and women on his writing staff. He saw it as an opportunity to \"say some things that you wouldn't be able to say in previous years.\"\n\nOn the film side of things, The Shape of Water leads with seven nominations, followed closely by The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, both with six nods. Lady Bird is also up for several big awards, although not for Best Director, which once again overlooked all female directors.\n\nThe TV awards are more widely distributed, with HBO's Big Little Lies leading with six nominations, but it's up against a slate of other prominent prestige shows, including The Handmaid's Tale, This Is Us, Master of None, Stranger Things, and The Crown.\n\nThe ceremony will begin at 5PM PT / 8PM ET on Sunday, January 7th, and will take place at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The show will be broadcast live on NBC, as it has been since 1993. If you're in need of some extra glamour, you can tune in an hour earlier for the red carpet arrivals, which will be streamed exclusively on Facebook.\n\nSo how do you watch? If you have NBC, you can watch through an over-the-air antenna, cable, or satellite. If not, fear not! This year, NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have reached a deal to allow for online streaming of the awards show. Simply head to NBC's app or website, or check your cable or satellite provider for online access. And if you're not a subscriber, most of these services offer free seven-day trials, so you can give it a shot without committing to a long-term subscription.\n\nTwitter will also be a great resource for following along with reactions and memes in real time, and The Verge will be reporting live on the night, with a running list of winners, reactions, and other news. So gather around the TV, gather round the internet, and let's celebrate Hollywood's finest.",

Although her 1989 world tour was successful, ticket sales for her more expensive and mysterious snake persona appear to be less favorable.\n\nHer \"longtime\" tour promoter told Billboard last month that he expected all dates to sell out, but this has not been the case. Reputation was the top-selling album of 2017, and the tour is expected to be well-attended, but ticket prices have been unpredictable and too high for some fans.\n\nThe Verified Fan program, which aims to reward music lovers, has been criticized for being a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens. According to the Post, those willing to spend $50 on merchandise can \"improve their position in line to purchase tickets,\" but once tickets become available, they are often too expensive.\n\nIn related news, tickets to Katy Perry's show in New Orleans on Friday are starting at $23.",

Her childhood years were spent at Graymont, the family home in Richmond, before she attended boarding school at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. It was here that she met her first husband, Topper Mortimer, and they began a love story that would take them to the pinnacle of society. Together, they moved to New York City, where Tinsley attended Columbia University and graduated with a degree in art history.\n\nAs soon as Tinsley landed in New York, her stunning blonde hair, her Southern charm, and her innate ability to build a personal brand propelled her into the spotlight. She quickly became the most photographed woman in the city, synonymous with the New York social scene. After working at Vogue, she transitioned to a career in public relations, always an entrepreneur at heart. She built a successful personal brand that was launched with a line of handbags, Samantha Thavasa by Tinsley Mortimer, a clothing collection, Riccimie by Tinsley Mortimer, which was sold exclusively in Japan, and a tabletop collection.\n\nTinsley then became the beauty ambassador for the iconic French fashion design house of Christian Dior and helped to create a lip gloss coined Tinsley Pink. She published her first novel, Southern Charm, and made her television debut in the hit TV show Gossip Girl in 2010. When she and Topper divorced, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City. A respite in Palm Beach gave her time to reflect on her accomplishments, and in late 2016, Tinsley decided to move back to New York City and prove that there is more to her than meets the eye.\n\nOnce back in the city she loves, she channeled her energy into her charity efforts, including supporting the Best Friends Animal Society. She is the celebrity ambassador for “No Dogs Left Behind,” a global animal rescue organization and flew to Beijing on behalf of the charity last year. Tinsley brought five rescues back to the states with her and adopted two from the group, naming them Strawberry & Shortcake.\n\nIn 2018, Tinsley teamed up with the cosmetic brand Winky Lux, to create her own collection titled XXO Tinsley for Winky Lux. She launched with a range of eyelashes in three different sizes, a giftset titled a Wink & Kiss, and created her favorite shade of lip gloss, appropriately titled Vodka Cran.\n\nNow that Tinsley is finally back and settled into her New York groove, she is ready to open herself up to finding the perfect match with whom she can continue to build her empire and share her special love for animals.",

Kelly has released a new 19-minute song, \"I Admit,\" addressing the sexual abuse claims against him and revealing the personal troubles that have plagued him throughout his career.\n\nThe track, which was posted to Soundcloud on Monday, begins with the lyrics, \"I admit I have made some mistakes/And I have some imperfect ways.\" Kelly then gets personal, singing that he likes \"all the ladies, that's both older and young ladies,\" followed by the statement, \"But tell me how they call it pedophile because that (expletive) is crazy.\"\n\nThe embattled entertainer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has long been accused of behavior that has ranged from questionable to criminal. He was accused of child pornography after a widely circulated videotape appeared to show him having sex with, and urinating on, a teenage girl. He was acquitted of all charges in 2008 and continued to rack up hits and sell out stadiums around the country.\n\nOn \"I Admit,\" Kelly sings that he's \"not convicted, not arrested, dragged my name in the dirt/All this work to be successful, when you abandon me 'cause of what you heard.\" The song also reveals that he was sexually abused as a child, with the lyrics, \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nKelly is one of pop music's best-selling artists and his hits include \"Ignition,\" ''I Believe I Can Fly,\" ''Step in the Name of Love\" and \"Bump N' Grind.\" He has also written hits for artists ranging from Celine Dion to Michael Jackson to Lady Gaga. While he's written classic love songs and even gospel music, he is defined by sexually explicit songs such as \"Feelin' on Yo Booty,\" ''Your Body's Calling Me,\" ''Sex Me\" and even more explicit fare.\n\nOn the new song, he says he was sexually abused as a child, singing \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nThe song has sparked outrage on social media, with celebrities and activists condemning Kelly and calling for his arrest. Rapper Talib Kweli Greene said in a Twitter post, \"His lack of self-awareness is atrocious. There are several lyrics I take offense to. The one I will address is 'I’m just a man.' I am also a man. I would never use that to defend this behavior.\"\n\nIn conjunction to the #MeToo movement, Viola Davis, Shonda Rhimes and Ava DuVernay and other celebrities participated in the Time's Up movement's #MuteRKelly social media campaign in April, calling for a boycott of his music and performances.\n\nKelly's concert in his hometown of Chicago was canceled around the time the Times' Up campaign took aim at the singer over allegations he sexually abused women. Weeks later, Spotify removed his music from its playlists, citing its new policy on hate content and hateful conduct.\n\nThe song was not released on Sony's RCA Records, where Kelly is signed. The label said it had no comment about the song. Kelly posted a link to the song Monday with the caption: \"Today is the day you've been waiting for.\"\n\nIn May, a woman filed a lawsuit against Kelly, accusing the singer of sexual battery, knowingly infecting her with herpes and locking her in rooms for punishment.\n\nKelly's new track is a bold move, but it's unclear if it will be enough to save his career, which has been put on hold due to the sexual abuse claims. The #MeToo movement has exposed the dark side of the entertainment industry and Kelly's admission may not be enough to repair the damage to his reputation.\n\nKelly's fans will have to decide if they can forgive him for his past mistakes and support him moving forward. Only time will tell if Kelly's admission will be enough to save his career and repair the damage to his reputation.",

However, the source added that Theroux is now pursuing Gomez via text message.

She explained, \"I used to feel guilty about taking personal time, but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before.\" The Ocean's 8 star and Jameel have been spotted together several times since June 2017, including in October when they were seen \"canoodling all night\" while grabbing dinner and bowling with friends in Massachusetts.\n\nJameel is an heir to the Abdul Latif Jameel business dynasty of Saudi Arabia, which owns the right to sell Toyota Motor vehicles in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. Hassan serves as the president of the charitable organization within the company, Community Jameel. Despite the rumors of an engagement, a source confirmed to People that the Doyle & Doyle antique brown diamond cluster ring Rihanna wore to Chris Rock's show at Madison Square Garden in New York City is not linked to an engagement.",

Because I’m a protective mom — I would do anything for my kids. And had I known some of the things they were experiencing… it just broke my heart, hearing some of that stuff.”\n\nThe media training session was so intense that Kourtney even flailed and laughed nervously at one point, but ultimately all of the women walked away with newfound confidence and knowledge.

Get the Scoop on His Lavish Lifestyle and Divorce Settlement with Kelly Clarkson!\"\n\nIf you've been following the latest celeb gossip, then you've probably heard of Brandon Blackstock. This American talent manager has a net worth of a staggering $10 million, making him one of the richest people in the business. But how did he get so rich? And what's his life like? In this exclusive article, we'll reveal all the details on Brandon's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about Brandon's net worth. As a talent manager, he's worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Kelly Clarkson. And it seems that his hard work has paid off big time. In 2023, Brandon was awarded a whopping $10 million net worth, making him one of the wealthiest people in the business.\n\nBut how did he get so rich? Well, Brandon has been in the music industry for over a decade, starting out as a talent agent for his stepmother, Reba McEntire. He later formed his own talent management company, Starstruck Entertainment, which manages the careers of many successful musicians and actors.\n\nBut Brandon's success didn't stop there. In 2013, he married Kelly Clarkson, the stunning singer and winner of American Idol. Together, they have two children and a luxurious lifestyle. In 2018, they lived in an $8 million mansion in Encino, California, before Kelly bought a $10 million mansion in the same neighborhood.\n\nBut things didn't go as smoothly as planned in their marriage. In 2020, Kelly filed for divorce from Brandon, citing irreconcilable differences. But before things could get too far, Brandon filed for spousal and child support, asking for $436,000 per month. A judge eventually ordered Kelly to pay him $45,000 per month in child support and $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years. She also had to pay him $1.2 million to cover his legal expenses.\n\nBut things got even more complicated when Kelly claimed that Brandon had defrauded her during his 13 years as her manager. She accused him of overcharging her millions of dollars and not being licensed to operate as a talent agent. Brandon's company, Starstruck Management Group, countered by pointing out that Kelly was always properly represented by her separate talent agency, CAA.\n\nIn the end, an LA judge sided with Kelly, ruling that Brandon had indeed overcharged her. But despite this setback, Brandon still walks away with a net worth of $10 million, proving that he's one of the most successful talent managers in the business.\n\nSo there you have it, folks. The inside scoop on Brandon Blackstock's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate. From his days as a talent agent to his current net worth of $10 million, Brandon Blackstock has come a long way. And with his stunning wife and two beautiful children, he seems to have it all.",

I don't know, it didn't really work. That is all I got.\"\n\nFaris also shared the hilarious moment when she was changing Jack's diaper and a \"little fountain\" of urine shot up in her face. \"And when you are changing the diaper, this crazy things happens -- I don't know if it is because they are relaxed -- suddenly you will get, like, a little fountain right up in your face,\" she laughed.\n\nDespite the challenges, Faris is still learning as a mom. \"I never sort of found myself as a natural, like, fit into motherhood but.... I don't know, I love my kid,\" she confessed. \"We have a blast. I hope he is going to be a good person someday.\"\n\nIn Overboard, Faris plays Kate, a down-and-out carpet cleaner who lands a job on a yacht that is owned by the affluent Leonardo (Eugenio Derbez).

After months of speculation, Jenner released a 10-minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her child. The announcement comes after months of speculation and a Calvin Klein campaign by all the Kardashian sisters that convinced fans that Jenner was expecting a child.\n\nFollowing the announcement that Khloe Kardashian is pregnant with her first baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, fans have been calling on Jenner to confirm the news. Some fans were frustrated that she didn't confirm it in a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, when Kardashian told her she was pregnant. Jenner and her boyfriend Travis Scott have been spotted looking loved up and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, indicating that they are still together.\n\nFans have been speculating about Jenner's pregnancy for months, with some pointing to an old social media video from the Golden Globes where they claim to see a baby bump. Photos taken \"months ago\" from her friend's birthday party also show Jenner in an oversized jumper, concealing her figure. The absence of Jenner from social media led to rumors that she had split from Scott, but a recent video put these rumors to rest.\n\nAfter 24 days of snippets from the famous Kardashian Christmas card, fans were convinced day 25, Christmas Day, would be the big reveal. However, Jenner was nowhere to be seen at all, leaving fans sure that she was heavily pregnant. Fans were still convinced a baby announcement was on the way after spotting a \"clue\" in one of the Kardashian Christmas calendar photos.\n\nDuring the upcoming Christmas special of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris Jenner revealed what she was most thankful for – and got very emotional. \"I used to pray that one of you guys would have a baby and now it’s like a faucet that we turned on that won’t turn off,\" she confessed. \"The fact that I have all these grandchildren...\" Fans couldn't help but make the connection following Jenner's pregnancy reports.\n\nIn pictures obtained by The Sun, a marquee lined with pink curtains can be seen set up at the back of Jenner's LA mansion, showing pink decorations filling the garden. Pink objects appear to be floating in the pool, while matching cushions adorn the seating area. Jenner appeared in pink silk pyjamas, suggesting the baby shower was for herself and she is expecting a baby girl.\n\nFans are convinced they know when Scott found out the \"happy news\" from Jenner, who has a huge net worth. On June 12, the star cryptically tweeted: \"Legit the happiest day of my life.\" According to Perez Hilton, this would coincide perfectly with the reported due date, and the pair went on to get a matching butterfly tattoo.\n\nPeople magazine originally reported that Jenner was due to give birth in February 2018. A source said: \"They started telling friends a few weeks ago. The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis!\" Another insider added: \"It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about. Everyone is overjoyed for her. This is the happiest she’s ever been.\"\n\nJenner has not confirmed or denied her pregnancy, but reports have already begun speculating about what she would name her future child. An alleged insider told Hollywood Life: \"She would like to do something both unique and keep the 'K' first name consistent with her sisters and mum.\" Fans thought she may have gone with the name Butterfly given that she and Scott both have matching small butterfly tattoos on their ankles. Jenner told Elle UK in December 2015 that she would delete her account as soon as she has a child. \"Once I have a kid, I’m not going to be on Instagram,\" she said. “You know, I’ll probably delete my Instagram and just... I don’t know, live life.”",

With the midterm elections just around the corner, the speech has become a vital opportunity for the president to sway voters and address the issues that are on the minds of Americans.\n\nThe speech is expected to focus on immigration, border security, infrastructure, tax changes, and strong economic growth in the U.S., as well as the benefits of the recently enacted tax changes and an America-first trade policy. The president will also highlight a national security policy of “peace through strength,” and use the opportunity to reveal the details of his long-awaited infrastructure plan.\n\nWhile the president has demonstrated considerable unpredictability in his first year in office, straying from scripted speeches and creating headaches for his staff, it remains to be seen whether he will deviate from the script on Tuesday. With the overall advantage for Democratic candidates over Republicans in the polls, lawmakers have a narrow window for swaying voters, and could face praise or backlash from their constituents, possibly affecting election results this fall.\n\nThe guest list for the State of the Union has been revealed, with the president and first lady inviting 15 special guests, ranging from workers and business owners who have benefited from the economy, to parents of gang-violence victims, to military members and public servants, to volunteers.

Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) will deliver the response, and is viewed as having star potential and is a member of a younger wave of Democrats.\n\nAs the nation prepares for the emotionally charged speech, many Americans are left to wonder what will be revealed and how it will affect the future of our country.",

Despite never working with Weinstein, Hanks expressed his disgust and shock at the allegations.\n\nWhen asked why Hollywood “sheltered” Weinstein despite rumors of his inappropriate behavior, Hanks rejected the excuse that his behavior could be considered old-fashioned. He asked, “Well, that’s a really good question and isn’t it part and parcel to all of society somehow, that people in power get away with this?”\n\nHanks emphasized that power in Hollywood can be rather manipulative. “I think it’s like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can,” the actor said.\n\n“They think their achievements entitle them,” Hanks said, proceeding to reference a quote about power. “Somebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: ‘When you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are,'” Hanks said.\n\nHanks agrees with the quote, saying he supports the negative backlash against the movie mogul. “I would say, there’s an example of how that’s true. Just because you’re rich and famous and powerful doesn’t mean you aren’t in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away ‘fat,'” Hanks said. “But I’m not, you know, I’m not the first person to say Harvey’s a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey — I’m not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn’t it kind of amazing that it took this long? I’m reading it and I’m thinking ‘You can’t do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don’t do that. That ain’t fair. Not her, come on. Come on!”\n\nHanks also commented on the sexism that continues to exist within Hollywood, referring to the show Mad Men, to which he says “had absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period.” He explained, “Those people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, ‘Hey, wait, that’s going on today? Shouldn’t we be on this?’ Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it’s happening? I can’t quite believe that.”\n\nThe actor joins other Hollywood stars, such as Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Patricia Arquette, Leonardo DiCaprio, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Lawrence, in speaking out against Weinstein. The backlash against Weinstein includes him being suspended by BAFTA, fired from The Weinstein Co., and having his $5 million endowment rejected, intended for USC’s School of Cinematic Arts ability to grant scholarships to female directors.

The 26-year-old singer is now living as a single lady, but Gomez still gets Bieber on her mind from time to time. A source close to Bieber says that Gomez is happy and busy with her life, but she still has lingering feelings for Bieber. If things fell apart, Gomez would be the first to reach out to him, but she is not going to interfere with Bieber's relationship with Baldwin.\n\nGomez has mixed emotions about Bieber's engagement. Some days, she is relieved that it has closed the door on their chance of a reconciliation and allowed her to move on. However, other days she can't help but feel disappointed. Gomez is still coming to terms with the fact that she and Bieber are over for good, so there are days when she still can't quite believe that he is engaged to Baldwin. For years, Gomez believed that it would be her marrying Bieber.\n\nFans speculated that Bieber had the engagement ring he gave to Baldwin picked out and made for Gomez instead. Bieber and Baldwin had a whirlwind romance that led to Bieber popping the question on July 7. They had only started dating a month before that, rekindling a romance that Bieber ended in 2016 because he didn't want to be tied down to one woman. The proposal was so sudden, and came just four months after Bieber and Gomez had called it quits again in March of 2018. However, Bieber seems to be happy and at peace with the decision to make Baldwin his wife. He even feels comfortable enough with Baldwin to let out his emotions, openly crying in front of her on August 8 while she comforted him.",

        "content": "\"The Hills\" Cast Unveils Secrets and Scandals!\n\nThe cast of \"The Hills\" has finally opened up about their biggest secrets, including the infamous sex tape that rocked the reality TV world. According to producers, the challenge was getting access to the real story behind the drama.\n\nLauren Conrad was the one who refused to mention Heidi Montag's name, and producers had to work with her to access what they knew was the real story. Meanwhile, Heidi was still trying to make up with Lauren and wanted to be a part of the show.\n\nBut the biggest scandal of all was the sex tape rumors that Lauren didn't want to talk about. Despite this being a huge betrayal, producers knew they had to work with Lauren to get to the bottom of it.\n\nThe producers were lucky enough to be at the nightclub where Heidi and Spencer Pratt might show up. They knew Lauren was there, and they were hoping to catch up with them.\n\nThe nightclub scene was explosive, and the producers had to rush to get their cameras there. They even had to avoid filming, but the fight between Lauren and Heidi happened so quickly that they had no choice but to film it.\n\nJustin Bobby Brescia, the anti-Spencer Pratt, was a surprise each week, as he was always putting on a show for the cameras. But off-camera, he was a genuinely nice person to everyone on the crew.\n\nIn Audrina and Justin's case, he was the bad guy who was really charming, and she was always trying to break up with him. Every time she would want to do it, they would have to have a conversation on camera so that audiences could see the process.\n\nLauren Conrad's mascara tears during her fight with Audrina in season 4 have become the GIF that keeps on GIF-fing from \"The Hills.\" But the producers actually received letters asking why she didn't wear waterproof mascara.\n\nThe mascara thing just happened, and it became a thing. Most of the time, when they were shooting, they would be sitting on their balcony, and the black eyeliner roll was their only device to tell stories.\n\nWe got so many letters that were like, \"Why didn't she wear waterproof mascara?\", and I never could answer that. I didn't know.\n\nIn conclusion, the cast of \"The Hills\" has finally revealed their biggest secrets and Scandals, including the infamous sex tape and Lauren's mascara tears. Will these revelations change the way we see the show? Stay tuned to find out!",

Its sequel, which hits theaters May 18, has already generated significant excitement.\n\nThis news comes at a difficult time for Donald Glover, who has been very busy with his own projects. He recently earned a slew of Grammy nominations for his alter ego Childish Gambino and has upcoming roles in the Han Solo movie and the animated The Lion King.\n\nWe are deeply saddened to hear this news, and our thoughts are with Donald and Stephen Glover during this difficult time.",

The fanbase was overly hyped about the film, and while it was amusing, it wasn't as funny as Guardians of the Galaxy. The characters' behavior deviated from their established personalities, and the pacing felt rushed. The Sakaar sequences detracted from the movie's backstory on Asgard, and I wish more had been shown of Hela. Odin's scene was also somewhat absurd.\n\nValkyrie is fine, but I don't like the portrayal as a drunk. It's a cliche, and it doesn't accurately reflect the character. I love her chemistry with Bruce, and I hope their relationship continues in future installments. There doesn't seem to be any romantic tension between Valkyrie and Thor, which is fine.\n\nLoki was the butt of jokes and seemed to lack his usual depth. He wasn't entirely in line with his previous characterization, and I question his relevance to the story. If Marvel doesn't give him a clear purpose beyond satisfying fans, his contract may not be renewed. I wouldn't be surprised if he's 'killed' off in Infinity War and then brought back to life in Avengers 4, perhaps as Kid Loki or Agent of Asgard Loki as Marvel introduces new Avengers members and seeks to reboot the franchise.\n\nI enjoyed the dynamic between Bruce and Thor, and I don't like the forced inclusion of the Black Widow scene. I would prefer to see more scenes featuring Valkyrie and Bruce. The events of the movie left me feeling like I was watching a fan fiction or side story. While it may be entertaining, it doesn't align with the tone I would like to see in future sequels. Despite the positive reception from critics and fans, I'm in the minority on this opinion.\"",

Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, Kim Kardashian West, is planning a special dinner for her hubby, Kanye West, on his 41st birthday this Friday. The couple will be hosting a low-key gathering at their Hidden Hills, California, mansion with their closest friends and family.\n\nKim told E! News that she wants to keep things simple for Kanye's birthday and just wants to prepare a small meal with loved ones. The rapper has been busy working in the studio over the past few months on his latest album, Ye, so he deserves a break from the madness.\n\nKim also revealed that she's staying in New York for a few extra days, while Kanye is at home with their daughter North, who had a unicorn-themed birthday party over the weekend. North needs her dad to be there when she opens her presents, so he'll be busy with that task.\n\nThis will be a surprise to Kim's fans, as she's known for her elaborate birthday celebrations in the past. Last year, she surprised Kanye with a trip to Japan for his 40th birthday and had the plane stocked with Japanese snacks and magazines for him to guess where they were going.\n\nWe can't wait to see what kind of surprises Kim has in store for Kanye on his special day. Will it be another extravagant celebration, or will she go for something more intimate? Stay tuned to find out!",

According to Sheen, their passion for politics was what ultimately led to their separation.\n\nSheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the '30s, told the Daily Telegraph that the Brexit referendum was what inspired him to become more politically active. However, their desire to make a difference in the world led them to take different paths. Silverman, an American, wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, while Sheen, a Welshman, wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.\n\n\"We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions—because she is American and I’m Welsh,\" Sheen explained. \"After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.\"\n\nDespite the difficult decision to part ways, both Sheen and Silverman acknowledge that each of them had to do what they needed to do. Sheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales, aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.\n\nAs the Telegraph puts it, \"Sheen sounds a little wistful\" about the impact that politics had on his love life.

ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey admits that coming up with a title is one of the most challenging things they do, but he's confident they've chosen the perfect one.\n\n\"We really want to make sure that what we settle on is perfect,\" Dungey said.\n\nStation 19, which falls under Shonda Rhimes' Shondaland banner, stars George, Jaina Lee Ortiz, Grey Damon, Barrett Doss, Alberto Frezza, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre, and Miguel Sandoval. Ortiz also announced the title on Twitter, along with a bonus video from the cast.\n\nStation 19 will premiere with a special two-hour event on ABC on March 22 before taking its usual \"TGIT\" time slot of 9 p.m. on March 29.

According to April Masini, a relationship expert and online advice forum host, the couple's pattern of breaking up and getting back together is a bad behavioral pattern that can become a source of strain in their daily lives. \"Drama replaces problem solving and breakups become a very disruptive part of the relationship dynamic,\" Masini said.\n\nSusan Winter, another relationship expert and best-selling author, added that reuniting with an ex is typically not worthwhile unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted. \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" Winter said. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.\"\n\nRachel DeAlto, another relationship expert, agreed that getting back together with an ex is often more trouble than it's worth. \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" DeAlto said. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.\"\n\nDespite these experts' advice, it's possible that Evans and Slate may be following the same line of thinking that has led to their previous breakups. \"They're a great odd couple, and Hollywood loves an odd couple romance,\" Masini said. \"And they're not insusceptible to what fans love to see, which makes their issues even tougher.\"\n\nThe good news is that breakups can often lead to positive change. \"A breakup can be an enormous motivator to improve ourselves,\" Winter said. \"The clients that come to me and tell me they've lost somebody they love are so incredibly motivated to correct and change things about themselves and their personality.\"\n\nWhether Evans and Slate will heed this advice remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: getting back together with an ex is rarely the solution to relationship problems.",

Caitlyn has acknowledged in interviews that she has a strained relationship with her ex-wife Kris Jenner and former Kardashian stepdaughters, though she maintains a connection with Kendall and Kylie Jenner, her daughters with Kris.\n\n\"The relationship on the Kardashian side has been strained recently,\" she admitted in an interview in August. \"To be honest with you, I don't really talk to them. I haven't talked to them in months and months and months.\"\n\nThe upcoming episode of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" will feature more on this topic, as Kim Kardashian continues to express her discontent with the claims made in Caitlyn's memoir.",

Since their separation, there have been various speculations about their personal lives, including claims that Brad had vowed to remain celibate for a year. However, Gossip Cop has debunked these claims, stating that they are fabricated.\n\nA recent report from The Sun claimed that Brad is determined to not get intimate with anyone as he continues to heal from his broken heart after ending a decade-long romance with Angelina. However, a source close to Brad has refuted these claims, stating that they are not true.\n\nBrad has not been in a relationship since his separation from Angelina, but has been linked with several celebrities, including Sienna Miller and Princess Charlotte Casiraghi. However, he reportedly wants to focus on himself and his projects, as revealed by a source to The Sun.\n\nIn professional terms, Brad will next be seen in James Gray's sci-fi film, Ad Astra, which is scheduled for release on January 11, 2019. After that, he will be sharing screen space with Academy Award-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which is set against the backdrop of the 1969 murder of Sharon Tate.",

With estimated net worths of over $100 million, it's hard to imagine the amount of hard work and dedication that has gone into his success.\n\nBut what exactly does Wade make his money from? The answer is simple: basketball and massive paychecks. Since joining the NBA in 2003-2004, Wade has made over $136 million playing the game he loves. His current contract pays him $15 million this season, with another $16.1 million due next season if he opts-in to his player option.\n\nBut Wade's success doesn't stop there. Along with LeBron James, Wade has mastered the art of taking short-term contracts to increase his flexibility and secure larger annual contracts. In 2014, he signed a two-year, $31.1 million contract with a player option, setting him up to be a free agent when the salary cap increases in 2016-2017. And when that time comes, Wade will be set to cash in on the biggest paydays of his career.\n\nHowever, even with all of his accomplishments, Wade was only the 21st highest-paid player in the NBA last year, according to ESPN. He made far less than players like Joe Johnson, Rudy Gay, and Brook Lopez. But that's not reason to feel bad for Wade, though. He's made tens of millions more in sponsorship deals, including a high-profile deal with a sports brand in China.\n\nOver the years, Wade has had sponsorship deals with Converse and Nike, but his biggest deal was with Chinese shoe company Li Ning. In 2012, he signed a 10-year deal with the company that few consumers know in the U.S., but which will pay him millions annually along with a reported $60 million stake in the company. It was a high-risk move for both Li Ning and Wade, and it's uncertain if it's paying off. Li Ning just reported its third straight year of losses, and its stock has gone almost nowhere since Wade signed the deal.\n\nOn top of Li Ning, Wade has had slightly less lucrative deals with Gatorade, Pepperidge Farm, Mission, and other brands. In total, Forbes estimates that he made $12 million in sponsorships last year.\n\nAdd it all up, and Dwyane Wade has made well over $200 million in his career. But after paying agents, managers, and living expenses, his net worth is likely significantly less than that. Estimates of his net worth are between $95 million and $115 million, and he has millions more coming in future years.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, Dwyane Wade has built a huge net worth and he'll likely add to it in years to come. And for those who have followed his career, it's clear that his success is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and willingness to take risks.",

Upon arrival, I discovered that the parlor floor, despite the unseasonable heat outside, was warmed by a roaring fire. As I waited, I realized that I was sitting in Harvey Weinstein's living room. He had purchased the six-story house in 2006, before marrying Chapman, and she had since transformed it with her style. The black floors and white rugs, chinoiserie, gilt, and glass, hydrangeas in a vase, and a Jo Malone candle completed the ambiance.\n\nA few weeks earlier, I had met Chapman at the Marchesa fashion company atelier, where she co-owns the business with Keren Craig. She appeared nervous and uncomfortable, mentioning that she had not been out in public for five months since similar accusations against her husband were made public. Today, she was more relaxed, though there was a sense of gallows humor. When I mentioned the warm weather, she quipped, \"Think of all the poor plants that are going to spring out and then die.\"\n\nWe moved downstairs to the ground floor, which was a large, open space with modern furniture and surprising art. There was a spacious kitchen that overlooked the backyard, and a TV room where Chapman's son Dash was sitting on a sectional encircled by some kind of electronic device. At 42, Chapman looked younger than in photographs, perhaps because she was more goofy than I had imagined. Although she retained her British accent, she was more laid-back than I had expected.\n\nOur meeting took place in Chapman's soon-to-be-ex-townhouse that had recently been sold by her soon-to-be-ex-husband. It was meant to be the first time she publicly addressed what happened with her husband. However, the night before our meeting, she called me late and sounded worried, apologetic, and unsure of whether she was ready to address difficult questions. I reassured her that we could discuss topics unrelated to her marriage to Weinstein. During our meeting, we primarily discussed her life before her marriage to Weinstein and her fashion company Marchesa.",

The alt-rock star, who has always been known for her edgy and rebellious style, embraced her new look with open arms. She showed off the brunette pixie with side-swept bangs at a performance of the hit Broadway musical “Dear Evan Hansen.” The singer posed backstage with the program from Broadway's \"Dear Evan Hansen,\" beaming with pride.\n\nAlanis Morissette also seemed to embrace her hipster side with her tinted, vintage-inspired glasses complete with gold chains. The alt-rock star served up another view of her edgy crop on Instagram, hard at work on her own Broadway show: the musical adaptation of her third studio album, “Jagged Little Pill.”\n\nAs we reflect on Morissette's past looks, it's hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia. When “Jagged Little Pill” came out in 1995, Morissette had perfected her signature, extra-long waves. They were great for all those head-banging moments in “Ironic” and “You Oughta Know.” Her signature curls added drama to her shows in the 90s.\n\nIn 2004, she made a major change and cut off most of her length, trying out a shaggy bob. More often than not, though, the singer has favored longer styles. Her sleek waves in an Instagram photo from earlier this year recalled her “Jagged Little Pill” days. Earlier this spring, she cropped a few inches and tried out life as a blonde. Now, it seems that the singer has made one of her most dramatic style transformations yet. We can't wait to hear more about her upcoming show!",

Her lips appear to be plumped up, but this could be due to makeup rather than injections.\n\nBeyonce is in her 40s, and her face still looks young and smooth, without many wrinkles. Her laugh lines are more visible, but this does not necessarily mean she has had botox.\n\nIt is evident that Beyonce has gained weight, but her breasts appear to be natural and not enhanced through implants. It is also unlikely that she has undergone a butt lift, as her curves were prominent even when she was skinnier.\n\nBeyonce's appearance has transformed over the years, and she has become more confident and beautiful. While there is no evidence to suggest that she has undergone plastic surgery, it is possible that she may have made other changes to her appearance over time.\n\nIn conclusion, Beyonce's appearance is flawless, and it is possible that her perfection is a natural gift.

He notes that the president's attacks on the media have led to a more confrontational dynamic, which has in turn led to a reduction in the quality of journalism.\n\nOlivier Knox agrees that the relationship between the media and the White House has become more strained under Trump's presidency. He believes that the president's constant criticism of the press has created a situation where the media is more likely to report negatively on the president and his administration.\n\nMona Charen argues that the media's role as a watchdog is important, and that the president's attacks on the press are an attempt to undermine this function. She believes that the media's ability to hold the administration accountable is essential to ensuring a healthy democracy.\n\nOverall, it seems that the relationship between the media and the White House has become more contentious under President Trump's leadership.

According to the Associated Press, Moore made the bold claim, \"I want Montana to be known as a decent state.\"\n\nDespite Moore's bizarre stance, the U.S. sales for yoga clothes have increased an astounding 45 percent year over year, while participation in yoga sports has only increased by a measly 4.5 percent. This means that more and more women are embracing athleisure wear as their go-to uniform, and for good reason - yoga pants are versatile, seasonless, and most importantly, comfortable.\n\nBut just because yoga pants are comfortable, doesn't mean they should be worn anywhere and everywhere. Here are some tips on how to wear yoga pants around town without getting the side-eye:\n\nDO: Learn from Lululemon's sheer pants recall. Make sure you select a pair that is truly opaque. Test them out in broad daylight or under bright lights.\n\nDON'T: Wear them to work. Ever. \"Dress Pant Yoga Pants\" is an oxymoron.\n\nDO: Invest in the correct size. It sounds like a no-brainer, but often women will purchase a size down to get a tighter fit or a longer shelf life since yoga pants stretch out. In reality, all you end up with is \"camel toe.\" Avoid at all costs.\n\nDON'T: Show your panty lines. If thongs aren't your thing, Commando and Zobha make great full-coverage bikini bottoms that are undetectable.\n\nDO: Layer up! Throwing on a leather jacket or a dark trench over your yoga pants and T-shirt will instantly dress up your look when you're running from bikram to brunch.\n\nDON'T: Keep wearing your favorite pair after the expiration date. Unlike jeans, yoga pants don't age well. Toss them when they're overly faded, stretched or ripped.\n\nDO: Accessorize! Nothing pulls together athleisure wear like a statement handbag and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nDON'T: Try to pull off your zaniest tie-dye yoga pants outside your ashtanga class. Stock up on neutral colors — navy, black, charcoal — that will go with anything.\n\nDO: Consider your tight-fitting yoga pants a thicker alternative to leggings in the wintertime. On the weekends, pair with knee-high boots and an oversized sweater, or wear them underneath a dress. No one will know the difference.\n\nTo shop the best yoga pants on the market, click on the slideshow below.",

The insiders further revealed that the couple does not want to discard the 11 years they spent together.\n\nSince Jolie, 42, and their children moved into a mansion near Pitt, 54, the actor has been spending more time with his children, including Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine. The insider noted that the entire family's dynamic has improved significantly, with Pitt now fully committed to sobriety and attending weekly therapy sessions.\n\nThe insider speculated that Jolie may have orchestrated the divorce as a way to motivate Pitt to change his behavior. Court documents obtained by the publication show that Jolie continues to use her married name and that the pair has requested the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case to keep the details private.\n\nThe insider added that if the petitions are withdrawn, the couple plans to hold a vow renewal ceremony as a spiritual reconnection. Pitt is reportedly keen for Maddox to be his best man, and Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. Jolie and Zahara will help choose a dress, while Vivienne and Jolie's other children will assist in other ways.",

The 32-year-old beauty flashed her never-ending legs in a pair of denim cut-off shorts, revealing her best Daisy Duke style. She paired the shorts with a lace cream shirt and trendy round sunglasses, exuding sophistication and style.\n\nAs Ashley met up with her Hollywood friend Cara Santana, the fiancée of former Desperate Housewives star Jesse Metcalfe, the actress's youthful appearance caught the attention of passersby. Ashley's long, dark hair was swept to one side, with a side fringe framing her face. Her cream lace shirt was nearly see-through, giving passersby a sneak peek at her black bra beneath. With a lace pattern along the body of the shirt, the garment buttoned up along the back.\n\nThe girls gathered around a mobile phone as they waited for the valet parking to take their car keys. Ashley sported one of the newest Chanel handbags, called the Flapbag, which will have set her bag a cool £2110. Cara kept things a little more low-key with black skinny jeans and a blue denim jacket, following the recent trend for double denim in Hollywood. Black brogues with silver tips, a black leather rucksack, and her Quay Australia sunglasses finished off her street-styled outfit perfectly.\n\nAshley posted a picture of the girls' Japanese dinner from trendy West Hollywood restaurant Izaka-ya onto her Instagram account, saying: 'Hello old friend... I've missed you!' The actress's post received numerous likes and comments from her fans, who couldn't get enough of her stunning appearance.",

Following her Best Actress Oscar win for 2003’s Monster, Theron was offered plenty of roles in action movies, but none of them quite fit her desired image of a no-nonsense female assassin. That is, until she came across the opportunity to work with director Karyn Kusama on Aeon Flux.\n\n“I got offered a lot of stuff in action movies that was either the girl behind the computer or the wife,” Theron revealed to Variety magazine. “When Aeon Flux came to me, I thought that could be something. I was never completely sold on the entire concept, but I really loved Karyn Kusama’s movie (Girlfight). So I threw myself into that with the belief that she’s a great filmmaker.”\n\nUnfortunately, their collaboration did not yield the desired results. The film received a lukewarm reception from critics and failed to make a significant impact at the box office. “And then we f**ked it all up,” Theron joked. “I just don’t think we really knew how to execute it. And it’s disappointing, but it happens. I’ve been in this business long enough to know that you cannot get it right every time.”\n\nDespite the setback, Theron was determined to take on the role of Lorraine Broughton in Atomic Blonde. And, after reading the script, she was immediately drawn to the character. “I might have gotten this right because of that (Aeon Flux),” Theron smiled. “You know nothing about this woman. It’s so rare that a female gets that in a movie.”\n\nFinally, Theron has the opportunity to play the perfect female protagonist, a tough as nails spy, and she’s convinced that Atomic Blonde will be a hit among fans and critics alike. The actress is eager to show the world what she’s capable of and hopes that her fans will be just as excited as she is to see her take on this new challenge.",

Jason Phillips, CEO of the Friant Water Authority, noted that recent rainfall had not solved the long-standing problem of nearly a decade of drought.

Harris is seeking to be more like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has worked for two decades to aid the agricultural industry. However, Harris' predecessor, former Sen. Barbara Boxer, was more aligned with environmental groups, which has led to a negative view of her in the Central Valley.\n\nSome participants lobbied Harris for her support of dams that have long been under consideration by federal and state officials, particularly the Temperance Flat Dam, which would be constructed on the San Joaquin River.

In an exclusive interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Keith Adams revealed that the entire stunt department was kept off set the day Thurman was allegedly pressured by director Quentin Tarantino to drive a vintage convertible at high speeds, resulting in a crash that left her with a concussion and damaged her knees.\n\n“Ms. Thurman’s accident was not a stunt,” Adams emphatically stated in an email to THR. “No stunts were scheduled for that day, and no one from the stunt department was called to set. I was not consulted or notified about Ms. Thurman driving a car on camera that day.”\n\nAdams, an experienced coordinator with a specialization in automotive work, added that if he had been involved, he would have insisted on using a professional driver and ensuring the car was road-worthy and safe. He did not specify whether he believed the stunt department was intentionally kept at bay to facilitate an actor performing dangerous driving maneuvers.\n\nThurman herself has described the 1973 Karmann Ghia as a \"death box\" and claimed that the incident was the result of a cover-up by production executives. The stunt coordinator's new statement underscores Thurman's account of the incident and highlights the dangers of allowing actors to perform dangerous driving stunts on set.\n\nMany people share safety duties on set, including producers, directors, and the stunt coordinator. However, in this case, Adams admits that he did not have the opportunity to intervene when changes to the shoot were made, leaving the safety of the cast and crew at risk.\n\n“On any set, my number one priority is the safety of the cast and crew,” Adams said. “Unfortunately, I did not have that opportunity in this case.”\n\nThis new revelation adds to the growing controversy surrounding the incident and raises serious questions about the safety protocols in place on set. The stunt coordinator's statement is a stark reminder of the risks actors face on set and the need for stricter safety measures to be put in place.",

In the judgment, Luann was required to create a trust for her children, which she agreed to do. However, the documents allege that Luann has never created the trust and instead sold the deed of the former couple’s marital residence in Bridgehampton, New York, for $8 million.\n\nThe documents state that Luann used the earnings from the sale to purchase a home in Southampton, New York, for $3.1 million. The settlement required Luann to “fund the trust with an undivided one-half interest in and to the Marital Residence.” However, the documents claim that Luann has never conveyed this interest to her children, in trust.\n\nNow, Luann’s ex-husband and two children are seeking to enforce the judgment and prevent Luann from listing or selling the home. A representative for Luann did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n\nThis emotionally triggering news highlights the heartbreak and betrayal that Luann’s ex-husband and children are experiencing. The failure to fulfill the terms of the divorce judgment is a betrayal of trust and a violation of Luann’s legal obligations.

In a heartwarming interview with the Today show, she confessed that she has talked babies with Audrina Patridge, who welcomed her daughter last year, and Heidi Montag, who is pregnant with her first child.\n\nHowever, she did not mention Lauren Conrad or Whitney Port, who are both also pregnant with their first children. It seems that Kristin has a special bond with Audrina, as she revealed that when Audrina was pregnant, she reached out to her for advice and support.\n\n\"When Audrina was pregnant, she reached out a lot and asked me some questions, like what pregnancy jeans I liked, and that kind of stuff,\" said Kristin. \"I've talked to her since she's had the baby, and she sounds like she's just loving life.\"\n\nKristin is also very close to Heidi, who is married to Spencer Pratt. In fact, she put together a list of different products and toys that she had loved and sent that over to Heidi. \"I put together a little list of different products and toys that I've loved and sent that over to her,\" said Kristin.\n\nBeing a mother is a lot of work, especially when your boys are as rambunctious as Kristin's. \"My boys are so close in age, so one minute they're best friends and one minute they're hitting each other, punching each other,\" she said. \"They get very violent with each other...I think just right now, that's the hardest part.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Kristin is grateful for her beautiful family. \"They're so sweet, they're incredibly loving, and they love to cuddle and they love their mommy. And that's the best feeling in the entire world,\" she said.\n\nKristin also revealed that her daughter, Saylor, is a \"diva\" who loves to roughhouse and is very different from her brothers. \"She's a diva, but she's a ton of fun...She may as well be another boy because she's the third so she wants to do whatever the boys are doing. She's pretty tough,\" said Kristin.\n\nIn conclusion, Kristin Cavallari is not only a stunning mother and fashion icon, but she is also a kind and supportive friend to many of her costars. Her love for her family and her dedication to being a mother are truly inspiring.",

She brought Justin and his siblings to previous Hotel Transylvania premieres and has many positive emotions associated with those experiences.\n\nDespite Selena's efforts to move on from Justin, her friends and family know that she still has feelings for him. However, they do not want to see them together again. Justin Bieber is currently in a relationship with Hailey Baldwin.\n\nSelena Gomez's decision to focus on herself and move away from Los Angeles is a positive step towards a healthier outlook on life. However, moving on from past relationships is not always easy, and Selena Gomez is currently going through a difficult time. We wish her the best during this time.",

Johnson, who was interviewed by Mic, explained that she needed the money to support her family and that she had been through a difficult period in her life. Kardashian was moved by the interview and expressed her support for Johnson on social media.\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump released a photograph of himself and Kardashian in the Oval Office, which was met with media scrutiny and criticism. The New York Post, for example, featured a joke about Kardashian's rear end on its Thursday cover, and the image was retweeted and liked thousands of times.\n\nThe response to Kardashian's request for a presidential pardon highlights the differences in how male and female leaders are perceived in society. Trump, as a male reality television star, is perceived as an alpha male who never backs down and is not afraid to accept criticism. Kardashian, as a female reality television star, is perceived as a glamorous and ageless icon who is often treated as a joke, despite her significant influence and ability to draw attention to important causes.\n\nWhile celebrities often use their platform to draw attention to important issues, Kardashian's involvement in prison reform was met with skepticism and criticism from some experts in the field. Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, expressed her concerns that Kardashian did not bring the necessary expertise and experience to tackle the complex issue of prison reform on a national scale.\n\nOverall, the response to Kardashian's request for a presidential pardon highlights the double standards that exist in society when it comes to male and female leaders and the importance of considering the qualifications and experience of those who take up important causes.",

Camilla is said to feel that Meghan and Kate are not suitable for the royal family due to their non-aristocratic backgrounds. The source adds that Camilla is known for causing trouble for the royal women and that bringing in Jolie is just another way to do so.\n\nThe source also claims that Kate is deeply troubled by Camilla and Jolie's growing closeness, believing that Camilla is trying to betray her. Kate is said to be worried about Camilla's conniving ways and has been advised by palace aides to closely monitor her interactions with Jolie.\n\nFurthermore, author Ian Halperin has accused Jolie of wanting to 'infiltrate' the royal family, suggesting that she has studied Princess Diana in great detail and has a secret ambition to marry into the royal family. Halperin even claimed that Prince Andrew is on Jolie's radar. It is important to note that these allegations are speculative and have not been confirmed by any official sources.",

        "content": "The biggest fashion faux pas for a wedding guest would be to upstage the bride. With all the attention and speculation surrounding Kate Middleton's gown for her upcoming royal wedding, it would be nearly impossible to do. However, there are other unwritten rules that guests should consider. Don't wear white, anything too revealing, or a hat that is too wide or tall to block the view of the person behind you. You can wear tasteful black, and be sure to cover your arms.\n\n\"This is not a place to make a fashion statement for yourself,\" said Sally Kilbridge, deputy editor of Brides magazine. She goes on to list more don'ts, including no miniskirts, plunging necklines, and novelty socks, which have become a surprising trend among guests at American weddings. The attire worn to a British royal wedding is appropriate daytime wedding attire kicked up many notches, Kilbridge said. Everyone's outfit should be chic, elegant, and suit the very formal, traditional occasion while not letting glitzy, black-tie, eveningwear trappings creep in.\n\nDesigner Reem Acra thinks Westminster Abbey could be the place for cocktail frocks, especially for celebrities and fashion editors who have long found reason to wear them before noon. The fashion role model for older women should be well-cut, luxe-fabric skirt suits, while Middleton's younger friends could pull off slightly retro, Hitchcock-inspired sheaths or pencil skirts paired with nipped-waist jackets. George Kotsiopoulos, co-host of E!'s Fashion Police, expects a lot of hats, but hopes they'll be toned-down cloches or a pillbox with a veil.\n\nVivien Sheriff, a British milliner who has made several dozen custom headpieces for wedding guests, said many guests will follow the lead of Middleton's mother, Carole, who is a fan of substantial hats. The hats Sheriff has made feature some feathers and crystals, but they're not oversized. \"You can't show off too much. You don't want to overdo it, but there is a lot of expression in the headpieces.\" Sheriff added that people aren't going to want to hide their faces, so the brims won't cover them. \"This way, everyone can get good photos and you can greet other guests looking them in the eye.\"\n\nThere will be more black than one might expect, Sheriff said. She had more orders for black than she expected. \"I guess fashion has changed and a lot of young guests want to wear black.\" However, black is fine as long as it's not funereal, according to Brides' Kilbridge, although the Middleton family won't wear it. Prince Charles' wife, Camilla, won't wear it either, Kilbridge predicted. Camilla will likely pluck something she already had in her closet, Kilbridge said, probably something not unlike the tailored dress and lovely coat she wore to her own wedding.\n\nMost of the male guests will likely don a navy or gray morning suit, which is basically the daytime equivalent of a tuxedo including a vest or waistcoat. All of William's military friends will be in uniform, Kilbridge said. A guest with a well-known personal style has a little more flexibility, said Kilbridge. It would be perfectly acceptable for Elton John, for example, to wear a flashy, embroidered vest under his jacket. Fashion fans will be eager to see David and Victoria Beckham, and Kilbridge thinks they won't disappoint, although she wonders how Victoria Beckham will dress her baby bump. \"They've had some crazy fashion moments, but this won't be one of them. She'll probably look fantastic. They want to create the impression that she belongs there. I think most people will be striving to look like they belong.\" That might have singer Joss Stone, who is famously barefoot almost everywhere she goes, digging to the bottom of her closet looking for a pair of shoes.",

These headlines have painted her as a \"crazy and manipulative\" estranged wife who is \"out for blood\" in the divorce fight and wants to \"embarrass and punish\" Brad by portraying him as a deadbeat dad. Furthermore, Page Six reported that Jolie had developed an \"insane jealousy\" of Amal Clooney, which caused her to believe that Amal has stolen her identity as the world's most glamorous and admired humanitarian.\n\nDespite these negative headlines, Jolie also published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency's efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children. The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.\n\nIn her piece, Jolie shared moving accounts of what education means to children whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war. She met these girls during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can't read or write, and has been \"robbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.\"\n\nJolie argues that wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war by providing resources such as school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps. She concludes that helping refugees in a \"patient, long-term manner, guided by our values\" is the wise and morally right course of action.",

But Kylie didn't personally confirm them until after she gave birth.\n\nKylie shared an Instagram post with fans as well as a 10-minute video of her pregnancy journey on YouTube. \"I knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress-free and healthy way I knew how,\" Kylie said. \"There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.\"\n\nKylie isn't the only sister who has had a unique baby delivery. Back in 2009, when older sister Kourtney gave birth to her first child with ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, Mason, the star famously pulled out her own baby during the delivery. In a 2016 interview with Today Extra, she revealed that it was her then boyfriend Disick who had filmed the birth that was aired on the family's reality show.\n\nKris is now a grandmother to nine grandkids.

The husband of Jill Duggar, star of “19 Kids and Counting,” was first accused of targeting transgender star Jazz Jennings, star of “I Am Jazz.”\n\nIn August, Dillard slammed the show as an “oxymoron” and declared that “transgender” is a myth. “Gender is not fluid; it’s ordained by God,” he wrote. But his hateful comments didn’t stop there. Last week, he doubled down, pitying Jazz and calling out the parents who allow her to promote her agenda.\n\nHowever, the backlash was swift and fierce. Fans and critics slammed Dillard for his ignorance and lack of respect. One wrote, “You claim to love everyone, yet you can’t call a transgender female by her correct pronouns.” Another said, “You are a hateful person. I mean it from the bottom of my heart.”\n\nIn a statement, TLC confirmed that Dillard has been cut from the show and will not be featured in future episodes. The network said his personal statements do not reflect its views and it is proud to share the story of Jazz and her family.\n\nDespite the controversy, “Counting On” will continue to follow Jazz and her journey as a transgender youth.

The board, who reviewed Weinstein's membership during an emergency meeting, released a statement saying it \"voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority to immediately expel him from the Academy.\"\n\nThe statement from the Academy read, \"We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over. What’s at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society. The Board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.\"\n\nMia Farrow, whose son Ronan recently published a New Yorker investigation with rape and sexual assault allegations against Weinstein's, took to Twitter to express her support of the board's decision. She wrote, \"I'm proud of the Academy for voting to expel Harvey Weinstein. Hopelessly grateful that we are witnessing the end of an awful era.\"\n\nRon Perlman also expressed his pride in the Academy's decision to expel Weinstein, tweeting, \"I'm proud of their decision to expel Harvey Weinstein. Time to make Hollywood great again.\"\n\nMarlee Matlin tweeted her support for the Academy, highlighting the issue of willful ignorance and complicity, tweeting, \"Bravo to the Academy for highlighting willful ignorance and complicity.\"\n\nThis move comes after several Hollywood figures known for alleged sexual misconduct, including Roman Polanski and Bill Cosby, remain members of the Academy. Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual assault by numerous actresses, becomes the second person ever to be kicked out of the Academy, after Godfather actor Carmine Caridi, who was removed in 2004 for illegally sharing Oscar screeners.\n\nThe Weinstein Company, which he helped to found, has fired him, and his wife, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Weinstein's brother Bob spoke of his \"waking nightmare\" and expressed his desire for his brother to receive \"the justice he deserves.\"\n\nThe fallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal continues more than a week after an explosive New York Times investigation detailed decades of sexual harassment accusations against Weinstein. The scandal has rocked Hollywood to its core and has sparked a much-needed conversation about the culture of silence and the systemic issues that allowed such abuse to go on for so long.",

The 42-year-old stated that she tricks her children Jackson, 6, and August, 2, into going to bed early on Monday nights, and then she opens a bottle of wine, takes a bath, and gets ready for her \"date night\" with the show.

She also shared a humorous memory about her costar David Oyelowo from their film Gringo. According to Theron, Oyelowo told a funny story that made her laugh so hard that she had to urinate in the middle of the restaurant. Oyelowo was not aware of what was happening and joked that she ran out of the restaurant.\n\nFor the latest Bachelor news, Theron recommends subscribing to their new podcast \"Watch With Us\".",

        "content": "On Saturday evening, a group of 82 women, including Cate Blanchett, Kristen Stewart, Jane Fonda, and Ava DuVernay, held a silent protest on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. The women stood together in solidarity, calling for greater representation and equal opportunities in the film industry.\n\nIn a joint statement, Blanchett and French director Agnes Varda emphasized the need for transparency and parity in executive bodies and work environments. They called for governments to enforce equal pay laws and for workplaces to be diverse and equitable. The women also acknowledged the efforts of those standing for change and called for the industry's stairways to be accessible to all.\n\nThe protest was part of the 5050x2020 movement, which seeks to achieve gender parity across all aspects of the film industry by the year 2020. The number 82 was selected to match the number of films directed by women in the festival's history, with only 4.3% of competition films in the past 71 years being directed by women.\n\nOther notable women involved in the protest included Salma Hayek, Marion Cotillard, director Patty Jenkins, and Haifaa al-Mansour. The protest was organized by French group Le Deuxieme Regard and the 5050x2020 collective, in collaboration with the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe protest comes in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #MeToo and Time's Up movements, which have sparked a renewed demand for change in the film industry. The movement also echoes broader calls for gender equality and diversity in the workplace.\n\nWhile progress has been made in recent years, with more women making the cut in competition, the statistics for women in Cannes are still dismal. Only one woman has won the Palme d'Or, and only one woman has been named Best Director. The festival has been criticized for its lack of diversity and inclusion, and for failing to provide a platform for women filmmakers.\n\nHowever, the rise of women in the film industry is undeniable, and the protest at Cannes highlights the need for continued efforts to promote gender equality and diversity in the industry. As the movement continues to gain momentum, it remains to be seen what concrete actions will be taken to address these issues and create a more inclusive and equitable film industry.",

Thieves made off with her 20-carat Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring worth £3.5 million and a case of jewellery worth £5.24 million. Nine men and a woman have been arrested and charged with armed robbery, and are providing details of what happened to the jewels to police. However, a US gossip website has claimed that the missing jewellery has been linked to Islamic jihadists. An unnamed source, described as a European official monitoring funding of terror groups, told the site that the stolen items have been tracked to black market dealers in Belgium. However, another US gossip website has disputed these allegations, with a source close to Kardashian's wife claiming that there is no knowledge of her jewellery being linked to terrorism. French police investigating the raid have admitted that the cache of jewels stolen from Kardashian has almost certainly been melted down or re-cut and sold off, making it unlikely that she will get them back. The president of a French jewellers federation has explained that the process of melting and altering the jewellery would involve removing all markings or modifying the shape, making it difficult to identify the original items on the black market.",

The news surprised fans who had been speculating about the couple's potential divorce for months.\n\nAccording to a report by Radar Online, several factors contributed to the decision to end their marriage. One of these was Tatum's desire to have more children. Despite being the parents of a daughter, Everly, Tatum reportedly wanted a larger family. However, Dewan was not on board with this idea. A previous report by OK! Magazine suggested that Dewan wanted to return to acting and that caring for a newborn would interfere with her plans.\n\nAnother factor in the separation was reportedly the couple's differing views on family life. Although Tatum was earning enough money to support the family, he wanted Dewan to be at home with Everly so she would not be raised by nannies. However, Dewan reportedly grew tired of being a housewife while Tatum spent his time on movie sets.\n\nAdditionally, jealousy is said to have played a role in the separation. As Tatum's fame increased with films such as 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, and its sequels, he became a sex symbol in Hollywood, attracting numerous women. Sources claim that Dewan was uncomfortable with the way Tatum interacted with fans, including flirting with them in front of her.\n\nIn an official statement released via social media, Tatum and Dewan announced their separation and stated that they would not be making further comments on the matter.",

Many muses have become partners or wives, such as Ingrid Bergman with Roberto Rossellini and Anna Karina with Jean-Luc Godard. However, the muse model is not always a straightforward relationship, as the French director Leos Carax admitted in an interview about the film Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, where his then lover Juliette Binoche starred.

Despite the fact that Griffin has only recently signed a massive five-year extension worth $173 million, management believes that if they want to recoup that investment, Griffin must end his relationship with Jenner before the \"Kardashian Kurse\" takes effect.\n\nThe Kardashian/Jenner sisters have been romantically linked with a number of pro athletes in the past, and this has often coincided with a decline in their performance. For example, Lamar Odom's NBA career suffered amid rumors that he was hooked on drugs while still married to Khloe Kardashian. Later, Khloe was romantically linked to Houston Rockets star James Harden during a stretch that saw his team's performance decline significantly.\n\nSimilarly, during his MVP runner-up 2016-17 season, Harden admitted that he felt the need to \"eliminate\" Kardashian from his life in order to return to his best form. Other athletes who have been romantically linked with Kardashian/Jenner sisters and experienced a decline in performance include LeBron James, Tristan Thompson, Reggie Bush, Kanye West, and Scott Disick.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Griffin and Jenner's relationship will have a similar impact on his performance, but Clippers management has made it clear that they do not want her to be a distraction in the locker room.",
