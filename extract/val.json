When asked about Jennifer Lopez, she responded by saying, \"I don't know her.\" This statement led to a meme and a feud that has been widely debated.\n\nAndy Cohen was the first to directly ask Jennifer Lopez about the feud in 2014.

Lopez stated that she was not aware of any past incidents and believed that the feud was largely the result of word of mouth.\n\nLast year, Mariah Carey was interviewed by The Cut and discussed gifts she received from her fans. She mentioned a fan-made shirt with a quote that she had made years ago, which was taken out of context and blown out of proportion.\n\nThe feud was reignited after Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey's performance at the Billboard Music Awards. Lopez responded to this incident by saying that she had watched most of Carey's performance and was only briefly distracted.\n\nLopez has recently been promoting her numerous projects, including Shades of Blue and American Idol. During a visit to Watch What Happens Live, she addressed the feud again, stating that it was not fair to criticize her for looking down for one second during Carey's performance.\n\nLopez also appeared on The Wendy Williams Show where she was asked about Mariah Carey. When Williams joked about Carey's statement that she did not know Lopez, Lopez responded by saying, \"She does say that. She's forgetful I guess.\"",

Just like his mom, Meghan, Guy has been on an incredible journey.\n\nBefore Meghan adopted him in 2015, he was on the verge of being put down by a shelter in Kentucky. But thanks to Dolores Doherty and her rescue charity A Dog's Dream Rescue, Guy was given a second chance. Doherty brought him to an adoption event just outside Toronto, where Meghan was living while filming Suits. Little did they know, Meghan was one of the hopeful dog owners.\n\nGuy's journey didn't end there.

The report concluded that YouTube is not doing enough to protect children from inappropriate material, as its gating procedures do not extend to text commentary, and that many popular search terms produce videos linked to ads for triple-X pornography without requiring age verification.

However, earlier reports indicated that the party could be held at a Swiss ski resort of Verbier, with Prince Andrew offering his ski chalet to hold the event.\n\nGiven that Prince Harry has become more restrained since meeting Meghan Markle, it is unlikely that the bachelor party will be as raucous as some of the parties he has attended in the past. Prince Harry is also said to be smoking less and drinking less, which could also affect the tone of the party.\n\nOverall, the public is eagerly awaiting details about Prince Harry's bachelor party, and speculation is rife about where and when the event will take place.",

Creator Joe Henderson tweeted out that the axing \"fucking hurts,\" and star Tom Ellis tweeted that he was \"gutted\" by the cancellation.\n\nAs Netflix picks up the show, it is clear that the Peak TV era offers more choices where one outlet's miss is another's hit. It also is worth noting that Netflix didn't even have the SVOD rights to \"Lucifer\" - Hulu did - meaning that deal had to be reworked, similar to the way Amazon recently revived Syfy's \"The Expanse\" after having to renegotiate SVOD rights as the first three seasons were sold to Netflix.\n\nThis cancellation comes as Fox undergoes a dramatic shift amid its studio counterpart's pending sale to Disney (or Comcast). Gone are niche comedies like \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" and narrow dramas like \"Lucifer,\" as Fox plots a shift to broader audiences with a slate of procedurals and multicamera comedies. It is clear that the cancellation of \"Lucifer\" is a reflection of these changes, leaving many to wonder what the future holds for this beloved series and its dedicated fan base.",

In a statement from Kensington Palace, Meghan confirmed that Thomas Markle would not be attending her wedding to Prince Harry this Saturday. \"Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health,\" she said.\n\nAs for Richard, he underwent heart surgery and was hospitalized following a week of statements about his health. A royal source told PEOPLE that Meghan's father \"has told Meghan he cannot attend due to medical reasons.\"\n\nMeghan and Harry are due to marry at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday. The decision on who will walk Meghan down the aisle will be made \"in due course,\" a palace source told PEOPLE.\n\nSerena has previously shared her wedding day advice for Meghan, telling ABC News, \"I think it's so important to enjoy the moment and eat cake. I didn't get to eat mine at the wedding. We were just having so much fun!\"",

In a blog post published by her radio station KABC, Tweeden detailed her encounter with Franken backstage before a show.\n\nAccording to Tweeden, Franken had written a skit for the show and brought props and costumes to accompany it. The skit featured Tweeden and a kiss, which she felt was unnecessary and made her uncomfortable. Tweeden writes that Franken repeatedly insisted they rehearse the kiss, despite her protests. When they finally did the line leading up to the kiss, Franken came at her aggressively and placed his hand on her head, mashing his lips against hers and sticking his tongue in her mouth. Tweeden writes that she pushed him away and felt violated and humiliated.\n\nTweeden also alleges that Franken groped her without her consent while she was asleep on the tour's journey home. She writes that she found a photo of Franken putting his hands on her breasts while she slept.\n\nFranken released a statement shortly after the accusations, apologizing to Tweeden and others involved in the tour, as well as to everyone who works for him and counts on him as an ally and champion of women. He stated that he respects women and does not respect men who do not, and that he will cooperate with an ethics investigation.\n\nTweeden's allegations come amid a growing wave of sexual misconduct scandals in Hollywood and beyond. In 2017, the New York Times and the New Yorker published investigative pieces accusing movie producer Harvey Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Other celebrities have since come forward with their own accounts of sexual misconduct.",

There are also rumors that she has ordered her security to delete a fan's camera photos and that she has been distant and snubbed fans at meet and greets.\n\nWhile some of these rumors may have some basis in truth, it is important to approach them with a critical eye and to not jump to conclusions without all the facts.

However, in light of the allegations made by Rapp, the Academy has decided to revoke its honor.\n\nRapp, who was just 14 years old at the time of the alleged incident, recently came forward with his story, describing how Spacey had made a sexual advance on him at a party.

He took 20-something pills in a week and 33 pills in nine days.\n\nThe new drugs changed him, she said, and his brain became different from that of someone who doesn't have a substance use disorder.

In 2007, he campaigned for John Edwards and later donated to Barack Obama. While some Obama voters may have shifted to Trump in 2016, there is little evidence to suggest that Kevin Bacon did so himself.\n\nIt is worth noting that Worldwide Politics is not the only fake news site that spreads false celebrity news.

Edge has this thing that he says about me, that I look upon my body as an inconvenience.\"\n\nWhile he does not want to discuss the details of his near-death experience, Bono acknowledges that it was a physical event that had a profound impact on him. \"It's just a thing that ... people have these extinction events in their lives; it could be psychological or it could be physical,\" he says. \"And, yes, it was physical for me, but I think I have spared myself all that soap opera.\"\n\nBono also reveals that his health scare was not the first time he has faced a life-threatening situation.

When people see me, I want them to say, 'Oh, there goes a fine Jew.'\"\n\nAfter a crude joke about Harvey Weinstein, David further stunned the audience with his next statement. \"I've always been obsessed with women and often wondered, if I'd grown up in Poland when Hitler came to power, and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp? I think I would.\" He then added, \"Hey Shlomo, look at the one by barracks 8. Oh my God, is she gorgeous?!... I'd like to go up and say something to her.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League has issued a statement criticizing Larry David's recent Saturday Night Live monologue, which some have deemed offensive and insensitive. The sketch, in which David discussed his dating prospects while imagining himself in a concentration camp, was met with criticism on social media before the show's conclusion. The ADL's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, tweeted his stance, stating that the sketch was \"offensive, insensitive & unfunny all at the same time.\" Greenblatt's criticism echoed that of many Twitter users who expressed their displeasure with the sketch.",

They can dance.'\" The 12 celebrity kids, ranging in age from 9 to 14, have brought Muniz and Fisher closer together, and they're excited to see them succeed. \"It is a true black hole of love, warmth, and genuinely rooting for each other,\" Fisher says of the DWTS family. \"They‚Äôve built this community unlike anything that I‚Äôve ever seen, and they‚Äôve all remained in each other‚Äôs lives.\"\n\nThe difference between this season and the original DWTS is striking. Juniors was pre-taped over the summer, allowing the kids to be out of school and giving the pro dancers the opportunity to serve as mentors. Cheryl Burke, Witney Carson, Sasha Farber, Lindsay Arnold, and Artem Chigvintsev are just a few of the pros who will be guiding the young dancers. The judging panel, too, has fresh faces, with Mandy Moore, Val Chmerkovskiy, and Adam Rippon joining forces to give the kids valuable feedback.\n\n\"It is a little bit different with the adults,\" Fisher admits. \"You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel. With the kids, I was so grateful that we had the judges that we did. Adam, Mandy, and Val did an unbelievable job at getting across some points they needed to get across, but from a place of nurture and of love and of expecting to see growth on the other end.\"\n\nThe kids have responded well to the critiques from the judges, and Fisher is proud of the progress they've made. \"I feel like it‚Äôs a little bit different with the adults,\" he says. \"You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel. With the kids, I was so grateful that we had the judges that we did. Adam, Mandy, and Val did an unbelievable job at getting across some points they needed to get across, but from a place of nurture and of love and of expecting to see growth on the other end. It was really beautifully done.\"\n\nMuniz and Fisher are excited to see what the future holds for Dancing with the Stars: Juniors, and they hope that viewers will tune in to support the young dancers. \"Frankie Muniz: I do hope that we can get the audience at home involved more with it going into the future, if we get to go again, but that all depends on if people tune in, so please tune in so we can do it again.\"\n\nAs for Fisher's Mirrorball trophy, he's keeping it safe at home. \"It‚Äôs in my bathroom right now,\" he says. \"I‚Äôm doing renovations on my house at the moment, so it is somewhere. It‚Äôs wherever the builders have put it, and I‚Äôm hoping that it‚Äôs in a safe place.\"\n\nDancing with the Stars: Juniors debuts Sunday, Oct. 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC. Will you tune in to see what happens next?",

According to these reports, Perry claimed that people in Hollywood view human meat as the best, but its \"gotten a bad rap\" due to \"squeamish Christians and their hypocritical virtues.\"\n\nDespite this theory, Perry has not denied it and has even included cannibalistic imagery in her music video \"Bon App√©tit.\" In the video, Perry is cooked in a giant, human-sized pot and served to other humans on a plate.

        "content": "The meteoric rise of Donald Trump and his seemingly unbeatable political prowess have left many experts stumped, seeking an explanation as to how this occurred. To fully understand this phenomenon, we must not only examine Trump himself, but also his devoted supporters, whose unwavering admiration and devotion to their unpredictable and often inflammatory leader baffles many.\n\nPsychologists and neuroscientists have provided numerous thought-provoking explanations for Trump's enduring support, but the accounts of these experts often vary greatly, sometimes overlapping and other times conflicting. However insightful these critiques may be, it is clear that further research and examination are needed to pinpoint the exact psychological and social factors driving this bizarre behavior.\n\nIn a recent review paper published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, UC Santa Cruz professor Thomas Pettigrew argues that five major psychological phenomena can help explain this exceptional political event.\n\n1. Authoritarianism: This refers to the advocacy or enforcement of strict obedience to authority, often at the expense of personal freedom. Those with authoritarian personality syndrome, a prevalent condition, often display aggression toward outgroup members, submissiveness to authority, resistance to new experiences, and a rigid hierarchical view of society. Trump's speeches, with their absolutist terms like \"losers\" and \"disasters,\" naturally appeal to those who prefer authoritarianism. Research has shown that Republican voters scored higher on measures of authoritarianism before Trump's rise, and a 2016 survey found that high authoritarians greatly favored Trump, leading to his election win.\n\n2. Social dominance orientation (SDO): This refers to people who prefer a societal hierarchy where high-status groups have dominance over low-status ones. Those with SDO are typically dominant, tough-minded, and driven by self-interest. Trump appeals to those with SDO by making clear distinctions between high-status groups (White) and low-status groups (immigrants and minorities). A survey found that those who scored high on both SDO and authoritarianism were those who intended to vote for Trump.\n\n3. Prejudice: While not all Trump supporters are prejudiced against ethnic and religious minorities, some certainly are. The Republican party has long used strategies that appeal to bigotry, such as \"dog whistles\" that signal prejudice to racists but not to others. Trump's shockingly direct appeals to bigoted supporters, such as calling Muslims \"dangerous\" and Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers,\" likely play a role in his popularity. A new study shows that support for Trump is correlated with a standard scale of modern racism.\n\n4. Intergroup contact: Contact with members of groups outside one's own has been shown to reduce prejudice. However, Trump's white supporters have experienced significantly less contact with minorities than other Americans. A study found that the racial and ethnic isolation of Whites at the zip-code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support, and this correlation persisted while controlling for dozens of other variables. Support for Trump increased with voters' physical distance from the Mexican border.\n\n5. Relative deprivation: This refers to the experience of feeling deprived of something one believes they are entitled to. Trump supporters who feel that American jobs are being lost to Mexico and China may be experiencing relative deprivation, particularly in swing states like Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This kind of deprivation is based on a skewed perception of entitlement, rather than an absolute lack of resources.\n\nThese psychological phenomena help explain the peculiar behavior of Trump's supporters, but further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.",

However, one guest who is noticeably absent from the list is Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister. Speculation is rife as to why she was left off the guest list for Harry and Meghan's wedding reception.\n\nPippa's wedding to James Matthews in May 2017 was attended by the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, but Meghan did not make an appearance at the ceremony. Despite claims that Meghan was present at the reception, no images have emerged to support this.\n\nIn the build-up to the wedding, there were reports that Meghan was advised not to wear anything similar to Pippa or Kate to avoid upstaging them. However, Meghan did not attend the ceremony.\n\nPippa and Meghan are rarely seen together, which has led some to speculate that they may be trying to avoid each other on the wedding day. Dr. Nyla Raja, a cosmetic dermatology GP and founder of Wilmslow Medispa, Manchester, believes that there may be similarities in their facial features, such as a similar eye shape, high cheekbones, and differences in lip size and jawline.\n\nHarry and Meghan have not revealed the guest list for their wedding reception, but it is expected to be significantly smaller than Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding at Westminster Abbey. The couple's closest friends, family, and celebrities, such as the Beckhams, Millie Mackintosh, and tennis star Serena Williams, are expected to attend.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Meghan reportedly attended a friend's wedding in Jamaica this weekend.

Late-night hosts latched onto her excuse, joking that racism might be a side effect of Ambien in spoof ads.\n\nThe manufacturer of Ambien, Sanofi U.S., responded to the comments, saying that racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.\n\nOn Comedy Central, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah joked, \"If you listen to their ads, there is a subtle warning about just [racism].\"\n\nIn related news, Roseanne Barr has been fired from her ABC show and talent agency after she made a racist tweet. The tweet caused a firestorm and led to her being fired from the show and the talent agency.\n\nBarr's excuse for her racist tweet has been met with widespread criticism, and she has been called out for her previous racist tweets. It's unclear if she will be able to return to the show or the talent agency.\n\nIn a statement, ABC said, \"Roseanne Barr's tweets about race are reprehensible and have no place on our air or anywhere else. We have terminated our agreement with her.\"\n\nTrevor Noah joked on his show that if Ambien is taken on Memorial Day, racist side effects are amplified. He also pointed out that if you've ever asked when there will be a White History Month, used the phrase \"I'm not racist, but...\" or previously tweeted racist things that your boss forgot about, then Ambien might be for you.\n\nOn Full Frontal, a fake ad for the drug showed images of individuals struggling to fall asleep with a voiceover narration stating, \"If sleeping through the night feels like a far away dream, try Ambien, the prescription sleep aid that helps you get a good night's sleep and possibly makes you racist?\"\n\nThe ad goes on to state that users should use Ambien if \"you've ever asked when will there be a White History Month,\" used the phrase \"I'm not racist, but...\" and \"if you've previously tweeted racist things that your boss forgot about.\" The latter statement was accompanied by an old tweet by Barr.\n\nOverall, the backlash against Barr's racist tweet and her excuse for it has been swift and severe. It's unclear if she will be able to return to the show or the talent agency, and she has been called out for her previous racist tweets.",

The 38-year-old was taken to the emergency room by her beau Geno and daughter Alana after she woke up without vision in both eyes.\n\nAfter examining her, a doctor revealed that Mama June was suffering from a detached retina and needed immediate surgery. The reality star was understandably worried about the procedure, as she feared she might lose her sight in her good eye. \"What if I lose sight in my good eye? I went totally blind in my right eye four years ago!\" she exclaimed.\n\nDespite her fears, Mama June underwent the surgery and it was a success. She was able to return home to recover, but there was still a 50/50 chance that she would regain sight. The family, including pregnant daughter Pumpkin, were overjoyed to have her back home, and Pumpkin even moved back into the house to help her mother in her recovery.\n\nHowever, there was also trouble in paradise. Mama June's ex-husband Sugar Bear was extremely upset because he believed that she was trying to keep their daughter Alana away from him. He left an angry message on the phone, screaming, \"You're a damn b*tch, June. Last time you're gonna mess with me.\" He even decided to throw bricks at a picture of Mama June.\n\nIn other drama, Sugar Bear's girlfriend Jennifer received a paternity test in the mail, as she didn't believe that he was Alana's birth father. The episode ended with Jennifer getting the results, and it was unclear what the future held for the family.",

However, it appeared that she skipped over another co-star, Reese Witherspoon, who was also a nominee.\n\nThis gesture has led to speculation that there might be a rift between the actresses. However, it is more likely that the broadcast simply did not show the embrace between Dern and Witherspoon. It is also possible that Dern was just gripping the seat in front of her as she was getting up, which would explain her absence from the hug.\n\nDespite the apparent snub, Dern did give a shoutout to Witherspoon in her acceptance speech, mentioning her as part of her \"tribe\" of four co-stars. This suggests that there is no bad blood between the actresses. It is also worth noting that the chairs on the stage can be in the way, making it difficult to give a hug to someone who is sitting directly in front of you.\n\nOverall, it seems that the absence from the hug was an oversight and not intentional.",

The judge emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy and strong relationship between the children and their parents, stating that \"not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them.\" The judge has also ordered Jolie to provide her children with cellphones that allow Pitt to call them at any time, without Jolie monitoring, and to refrain from reading their text messages with their father.\n\nThe court has outlined a summer schedule for the children, except for Maddox, who is old enough to decide how much time he wants to spend with Pitt. Pitt will have custody of the children from June 8 to June 17, for four hours per day, while he stays in London, where Jolie is renting a house. He will designate one or two minor children to spend time with at a time and will also spend time with each child at least twice during this 10-day period. Jolie will not be present during or interfere with Pitt's custodial time.\n\nPitt will also have custody of the children from July 8 to July 14, when a doctor will be required to be present and will meet with the children before and after each two-day period. From July 21 to July 29, Pitt will resume custody of the children when he returns to California. The court noted that if the minor children remain closed off to their father, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with Jolie and may lead to primary physical custody being ordered in Pitt's favor.\n\nJolie's spokesperson has expressed disappointment at the release of confidential court records, stating that it is not in the best interests of the children. The spokesperson emphasized that Jolie has been focused on the children's health and needs throughout the divorce.",

However, it is important to note that Pitt and Jolie made a pact to not date anyone until their divorce was officially settled. Oxman is said to be very respectful of Jolie and will not rub their new relationship in her face.\n\nThe Sun reports that the idea of \"upgrading\" with each relationship is an interesting concept, but it remains to be seen whether Oxman is an upgrade from Jolie or if Pitt's wish list of demands will continue to grow. As for Jolie, she is currently in England with her children and is not dating anyone. It is unclear when Pitt will see his children or introduce Oxman to them.",

The singer, accompanied by her daughter Blue Ivy and husband Jay-Z, was seen in a long, stomach-covering gown with a low-cut neckline and a revealing cleavage. While some fans speculate that the dress may have been strategically designed to hide a baby bump, others point out that Beyonce has performed while pregnant before, so it's possible that she is not actually with child.\n\nThe rumors began after Beyonce appeared to give a subtle hint that she was pregnant during a concert stop on her On The Run II tour in Rome on July 8. In fan footage from the concert, she can be seen briefly rubbing her stomach. This gesture led some fans to speculate that she was pregnant, and she confirmed the news at the 2011 VMAs, where she revealed that she was pregnant with daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nBeyonce and Jay-Z have a history of naming their albums after the number four, with Beyonce releasing 4 in 2011 and Jay-Z releasing 4:44 in 2017. It's possible that they may choose to name their fourth child after this number, adding to the rumors that a fourth child is on the way for the Carters.\n\nWhile Beyonce's appearance may be causing some to speculate about a possible baby bump, it's important to remember that appearances can be deceiving and that only time will tell if she is actually pregnant.",

Pitt must arrange for visits with doctors and a therapist during his time with the kids, while Jolie is only allowed to call the kids once per day at a time agreed in advance by both parents.\n\nA source previously told ET that Pitt is focusing on co-parenting and fatherhood over dating. \"Brad was taking time to date, when he had the time,\" the source said. \"But now all he wants to do is focus on family.\" The source also added that Pitt and Jolie \"still don't get along at all\" and \"can barely be in the same room.\"",

However, the devastating truth was revealed to be something entirely different.\n\nIn a poignant storyline, we were given a glimpse into two defining moments in Jack's life: the day he met his wife Rebecca and the day he irreparably damaged their relationship. The first revealed Jack to be a hardworking handyman and mechanic, saving money and dreaming of a better future. He finally won a large poker game, but was robbed and assaulted by his competitors. In a fit of rage, Jack decides to plot his revenge by stealing money from the cash register of the men who attacked him. Instead, he falls in love with Rebecca, a love that would ultimately lead to heartbreak.\n\nIn the second, heart-wrenching storyline, Jack is devastated by his wife's decision to go on tour for weeks on end. He is so angry and hurt that he gets drunk on his way to her performance and continues to drink even when he arrives. As viewers know, Jack has struggled with alcoholism, a struggle that he tried to overcome when his children were young.\n\nDespite his drunken behavior, Jack finds himself kicked out of Rebecca's performance and forced to drive home. When they arrive, Rebecca demands to know what Jack loves about her in that moment, not in the past. In a heart-wrenching moment, Jack professes his love for her as a mother, as a woman who is still beautiful, who still makes him laugh, who still dances with all his heart, and who is still the same woman who ran out of a blind date all those years ago because she had to sing.\n\nHowever, even with this passionate declaration of love, Jack leaves the Pearson household as a symbol of his penance for his terrible behavior, leaving his wife and children heartbroken in his wake.",

        "content": "As the 75th Golden Globe Awards grace us with their presence this weekend, the anticipation is palpable. Hollywood's least serious award show is set to kick off the awards season, and while it may not hold the same weight as the Oscars, it often foreshadows the direction that the industry is heading in. Hosting the show this year is none other than Seth Meyers, who you may recognize from his NBC late-night show, \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\"\n\nThis will be Meyers' first time hosting the Golden Globes, but he's not exactly a stranger to talk show hosting. He'll be following in the footsteps of Jimmy Fallon, who hosted last year. NBC is marketing the show under the tagline \"Hollywood, we have a lot to talk about,\" so expect lots of humor and not-at-all uncomfortable and awkward moments about the recent turmoil in Hollywood over sexual harassment and abuse.\n\nMeyers spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about taking on the gig, revealing that he discussed it with his wife and women on his writing staff. He saw it as an opportunity to \"say some things that you wouldn't be able to say in previous years.\"\n\nOn the film side of things, The Shape of Water leads with seven nominations, followed closely by The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, both with six nods. Lady Bird is also up for several big awards, although not for Best Director, which once again overlooked all female directors.\n\nThe TV awards are more widely distributed, with HBO's Big Little Lies leading with six nominations, but it's up against a slate of other prominent prestige shows, including The Handmaid's Tale, This Is Us, Master of None, Stranger Things, and The Crown.\n\nThe ceremony will begin at 5PM PT / 8PM ET on Sunday, January 7th, and will take place at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The show will be broadcast live on NBC, as it has been since 1993. If you're in need of some extra glamour, you can tune in an hour earlier for the red carpet arrivals, which will be streamed exclusively on Facebook.\n\nSo how do you watch? If you have NBC, you can watch through an over-the-air antenna, cable, or satellite. If not, fear not! This year, NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have reached a deal to allow for online streaming of the awards show. Simply head to NBC's app or website, or check your cable or satellite provider for online access. And if you're not a subscriber, most of these services offer free seven-day trials, so you can give it a shot without committing to a long-term subscription.\n\nTwitter will also be a great resource for following along with reactions and memes in real time, and The Verge will be reporting live on the night, with a running list of winners, reactions, and other news. So gather around the TV, gather round the internet, and let's celebrate Hollywood's finest.",

Her childhood years were spent at Graymont, the family home in Richmond, before she attended boarding school at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. It was here that she met her first husband, Topper Mortimer, and they began a love story that would take them to the pinnacle of society. Together, they moved to New York City, where Tinsley attended Columbia University and graduated with a degree in art history.\n\nAs soon as Tinsley landed in New York, her stunning blonde hair, her Southern charm, and her innate ability to build a personal brand propelled her into the spotlight. She quickly became the most photographed woman in the city, synonymous with the New York social scene. After working at Vogue, she transitioned to a career in public relations, always an entrepreneur at heart. She built a successful personal brand that was launched with a line of handbags, Samantha Thavasa by Tinsley Mortimer, a clothing collection, Riccimie by Tinsley Mortimer, which was sold exclusively in Japan, and a tabletop collection.\n\nTinsley then became the beauty ambassador for the iconic French fashion design house of Christian Dior and helped to create a lip gloss coined Tinsley Pink. She published her first novel, Southern Charm, and made her television debut in the hit TV show Gossip Girl in 2010. When she and Topper divorced, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City. A respite in Palm Beach gave her time to reflect on her accomplishments, and in late 2016, Tinsley decided to move back to New York City and prove that there is more to her than meets the eye.\n\nOnce back in the city she loves, she channeled her energy into her charity efforts, including supporting the Best Friends Animal Society. She is the celebrity ambassador for ‚ÄúNo Dogs Left Behind,‚Äù a global animal rescue organization and flew to Beijing on behalf of the charity last year. Tinsley brought five rescues back to the states with her and adopted two from the group, naming them Strawberry & Shortcake.\n\nIn 2018, Tinsley teamed up with the cosmetic brand Winky Lux, to create her own collection titled XXO Tinsley for Winky Lux. She launched with a range of eyelashes in three different sizes, a giftset titled a Wink & Kiss, and created her favorite shade of lip gloss, appropriately titled Vodka Cran.\n\nNow that Tinsley is finally back and settled into her New York groove, she is ready to open herself up to finding the perfect match with whom she can continue to build her empire and share her special love for animals.",

Kelly has released a new 19-minute song, \"I Admit,\" addressing the sexual abuse claims against him and revealing the personal troubles that have plagued him throughout his career.\n\nThe track, which was posted to Soundcloud on Monday, begins with the lyrics, \"I admit I have made some mistakes/And I have some imperfect ways.\" Kelly then gets personal, singing that he likes \"all the ladies, that's both older and young ladies,\" followed by the statement, \"But tell me how they call it pedophile because that (expletive) is crazy.\"\n\nThe embattled entertainer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has long been accused of behavior that has ranged from questionable to criminal. He was accused of child pornography after a widely circulated videotape appeared to show him having sex with, and urinating on, a teenage girl. He was acquitted of all charges in 2008 and continued to rack up hits and sell out stadiums around the country.\n\nOn \"I Admit,\" Kelly sings that he's \"not convicted, not arrested, dragged my name in the dirt/All this work to be successful, when you abandon me 'cause of what you heard.\" The song also reveals that he was sexually abused as a child, with the lyrics, \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nKelly is one of pop music's best-selling artists and his hits include \"Ignition,\" ''I Believe I Can Fly,\" ''Step in the Name of Love\" and \"Bump N' Grind.\" He has also written hits for artists ranging from Celine Dion to Michael Jackson to Lady Gaga. While he's written classic love songs and even gospel music, he is defined by sexually explicit songs such as \"Feelin' on Yo Booty,\" ''Your Body's Calling Me,\" ''Sex Me\" and even more explicit fare.\n\nOn the new song, he says he was sexually abused as a child, singing \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nThe song has sparked outrage on social media, with celebrities and activists condemning Kelly and calling for his arrest. Rapper Talib Kweli Greene said in a Twitter post, \"His lack of self-awareness is atrocious. There are several lyrics I take offense to. The one I will address is 'I‚Äôm just a man.' I am also a man. I would never use that to defend this behavior.\"\n\nIn conjunction to the #MeToo movement, Viola Davis, Shonda Rhimes and Ava DuVernay and other celebrities participated in the Time's Up movement's #MuteRKelly social media campaign in April, calling for a boycott of his music and performances.\n\nKelly's concert in his hometown of Chicago was canceled around the time the Times' Up campaign took aim at the singer over allegations he sexually abused women. Weeks later, Spotify removed his music from its playlists, citing its new policy on hate content and hateful conduct.\n\nThe song was not released on Sony's RCA Records, where Kelly is signed. The label said it had no comment about the song. Kelly posted a link to the song Monday with the caption: \"Today is the day you've been waiting for.\"\n\nIn May, a woman filed a lawsuit against Kelly, accusing the singer of sexual battery, knowingly infecting her with herpes and locking her in rooms for punishment.\n\nKelly's new track is a bold move, but it's unclear if it will be enough to save his career, which has been put on hold due to the sexual abuse claims. The #MeToo movement has exposed the dark side of the entertainment industry and Kelly's admission may not be enough to repair the damage to his reputation.\n\nKelly's fans will have to decide if they can forgive him for his past mistakes and support him moving forward. Only time will tell if Kelly's admission will be enough to save his career and repair the damage to his reputation.",

As a talent manager, he's worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Kelly Clarkson. And it seems that his hard work has paid off big time. In 2023, Brandon was awarded a whopping $10 million net worth, making him one of the wealthiest people in the business.\n\nBut how did he get so rich? Well, Brandon has been in the music industry for over a decade, starting out as a talent agent for his stepmother, Reba McEntire. He later formed his own talent management company, Starstruck Entertainment, which manages the careers of many successful musicians and actors.\n\nBut Brandon's success didn't stop there. In 2013, he married Kelly Clarkson, the stunning singer and winner of American Idol. Together, they have two children and a luxurious lifestyle. In 2018, they lived in an $8 million mansion in Encino, California, before Kelly bought a $10 million mansion in the same neighborhood.\n\nBut things didn't go as smoothly as planned in their marriage. In 2020, Kelly filed for divorce from Brandon, citing irreconcilable differences. But before things could get too far, Brandon filed for spousal and child support, asking for $436,000 per month. A judge eventually ordered Kelly to pay him $45,000 per month in child support and $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years. She also had to pay him $1.2 million to cover his legal expenses.\n\nBut things got even more complicated when Kelly claimed that Brandon had defrauded her during his 13 years as her manager. She accused him of overcharging her millions of dollars and not being licensed to operate as a talent agent. Brandon's company, Starstruck Management Group, countered by pointing out that Kelly was always properly represented by her separate talent agency, CAA.\n\nIn the end, an LA judge sided with Kelly, ruling that Brandon had indeed overcharged her. But despite this setback, Brandon still walks away with a net worth of $10 million, proving that he's one of the most successful talent managers in the business.\n\nSo there you have it, folks. The inside scoop on Brandon Blackstock's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate. From his days as a talent agent to his current net worth of $10 million, Brandon Blackstock has come a long way. And with his stunning wife and two beautiful children, he seems to have it all.",

After months of speculation, Jenner released a 10-minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her child. The announcement comes after months of speculation and a Calvin Klein campaign by all the Kardashian sisters that convinced fans that Jenner was expecting a child.\n\nFollowing the announcement that Khloe Kardashian is pregnant with her first baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, fans have been calling on Jenner to confirm the news. Some fans were frustrated that she didn't confirm it in a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, when Kardashian told her she was pregnant. Jenner and her boyfriend Travis Scott have been spotted looking loved up and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, indicating that they are still together.\n\nFans have been speculating about Jenner's pregnancy for months, with some pointing to an old social media video from the Golden Globes where they claim to see a baby bump. Photos taken \"months ago\" from her friend's birthday party also show Jenner in an oversized jumper, concealing her figure. The absence of Jenner from social media led to rumors that she had split from Scott, but a recent video put these rumors to rest.\n\nAfter 24 days of snippets from the famous Kardashian Christmas card, fans were convinced day 25, Christmas Day, would be the big reveal. However, Jenner was nowhere to be seen at all, leaving fans sure that she was heavily pregnant. Fans were still convinced a baby announcement was on the way after spotting a \"clue\" in one of the Kardashian Christmas calendar photos.\n\nDuring the upcoming Christmas special of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris Jenner revealed what she was most thankful for ‚Äì and got very emotional. \"I used to pray that one of you guys would have a baby and now it‚Äôs like a faucet that we turned on that won‚Äôt turn off,\" she confessed. \"The fact that I have all these grandchildren...\" Fans couldn't help but make the connection following Jenner's pregnancy reports.\n\nIn pictures obtained by The Sun, a marquee lined with pink curtains can be seen set up at the back of Jenner's LA mansion, showing pink decorations filling the garden. Pink objects appear to be floating in the pool, while matching cushions adorn the seating area. Jenner appeared in pink silk pyjamas, suggesting the baby shower was for herself and she is expecting a baby girl.\n\nFans are convinced they know when Scott found out the \"happy news\" from Jenner, who has a huge net worth. On June 12, the star cryptically tweeted: \"Legit the happiest day of my life.\" According to Perez Hilton, this would coincide perfectly with the reported due date, and the pair went on to get a matching butterfly tattoo.\n\nPeople magazine originally reported that Jenner was due to give birth in February 2018. A source said: \"They started telling friends a few weeks ago. The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis!\" Another insider added: \"It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about. Everyone is overjoyed for her. This is the happiest she‚Äôs ever been.\"\n\nJenner has not confirmed or denied her pregnancy, but reports have already begun speculating about what she would name her future child. An alleged insider told Hollywood Life: \"She would like to do something both unique and keep the 'K' first name consistent with her sisters and mum.\" Fans thought she may have gone with the name Butterfly given that she and Scott both have matching small butterfly tattoos on their ankles. Jenner told Elle UK in December 2015 that she would delete her account as soon as she has a child. \"Once I have a kid, I‚Äôm not going to be on Instagram,\" she said. ‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôll probably delete my Instagram and just...

His passing comes as a shock to those who knew him and his close circle of collaborators, including his girlfriend Asia Argento, who was by his side as he struggled with his demons.\n\nAs news of his apparent suicide spread, Argento was active on social media, posting heart-wrenching messages that reveal the depth of her love and admiration for the man she called her \"rock.\" In one photo, she captioned a torn t-shirt with the simple message, \"F--- EVERYONE,\" and wrote, \"You know who you are.\" The post was deleted soon after, leaving behind a haunting reminder of the pain and confusion that often accompanies the loss of someone we love.\n\nBourdain, the host of CNN's Parts Unknown, was found unresponsive in his hotel room in France on Friday morning by his friend and French chef Eric Ripert, who had been filming an upcoming episode with him. According to CNN, the cause of death has not yet been determined, but \"at this stage, nothing suggests the intervention of a third party.\"\n\nArgento and Bourdain met in 2016 when they collaborated on an episode of Parts Unknown in Rome. She became heavily involved in his creative process and directed an upcoming episode set in Hong Kong. Bourdain often consulted her for her vast knowledge of music and film, and he spoke openly about how much he cherished her presence in his life.\n\nIn a heart-wrenching statement, Argento said, \"Anthony gave all of himself in everything that he did. His brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds. He was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated. My thoughts are with his family. I would ask that you respect their privacy and mine.\"\n\nAs the world mourns the loss of this incredible man, we must remember to take care of ourselves and those we love. If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).",

However, Mandel has not confirmed these rumors. According to an unnamed source, Mandel is proud of the career that he helped give to Markle, who appeared on his show \"Deal or No Deal\" from 2006 to 2007. The source added that it would be nice if Markle invited Mandel to the wedding.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has debunked these rumors. The publication reached out to Mandel's representative, who denied the claims. The representative said that the report claiming that Mandel wants an invitation to the royal wedding is \"made-up.\"\n\nIt is also worth noting that Mandel never made a similar request for an invitation to Chrissy Teigen's wedding, despite her also appearing on the show. The show aired for four years and involved dozens of briefcase girls, making it unlikely that Mandel would expect an invitation to all of their weddings.\n\nIn other news, Markle has spoken about her appearance on \"Deal or No Deal\" in the past. She revealed that she appeared on the show in order to make ends meet, as she was still an auditioning actress and was waiting for a big break in her career. The photo of Markle wearing a sexy Santa outfit has resurfaced online, and it includes Mandel and other members of the show's cast.\n\nMarkle is expected to have her parents, Tom Markle and Doria Radlan, involved in her wedding. She has expressed a desire to stick with traditions and have her dad walk her down the aisle.\n\nOverall, while Mandel's invite to the royal wedding remains unconfirmed, it is unlikely that he will receive an invitation.",

The photo shoot is said to be Jenner's \"fine hour\" since her transition.\n\nAlthough the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be supportive of Jenner's transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is \"their worst nightmare.\" A source told DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of Jenner's plan from her model son Brody and were shocked by the idea.\n\n\"Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that‚Äôs unacceptable, it‚Äôs taking things too far,' the source said.

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'\n\nKris, the Kardashian matriarch, is said to be determined to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the source. \"She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,' said the source.

A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nJenner's family is said to feel that she has been milking her fame and riding on their coattails for too long. They feel that if she wants to do things her way, she should be on her own. While the operation was inevitable, they think her plan to do a nude spread is over the top and something that is really annoying to them.",

With the overall advantage for Democratic candidates over Republicans in the polls, lawmakers have a narrow window for swaying voters, and could face praise or backlash from their constituents, possibly affecting election results this fall.\n\nThe guest list for the State of the Union has been revealed, with the president and first lady inviting 15 special guests, ranging from workers and business owners who have benefited from the economy, to parents of gang-violence victims, to military members and public servants, to volunteers. However, several House Democrats have announced they will not attend, including Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), John Lewis (D-Ga.), Jan Schakowsky, (D-Ill.), Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.). Rep. Jayapal, Lewis, Waters, and Wilson decided to skip it after Trump‚Äôs incendiary comments on Haiti and other African countries.\n\nThe designated survivor on Tuesday evening has been announced as Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who has traveled to more than 30 states since his confirmation last April, addressing the concerns of farmers and rural Americans. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) will deliver the response, and is viewed as having star potential and is a member of a younger wave of Democrats.\n\nAs the nation prepares for the emotionally charged speech, many Americans are left to wonder what will be revealed and how it will affect the future of our country.",

        "content": "The beloved veteran actor, Tom Hanks, spoke to The New York Times about the recently uncovered allegations of harassment and assault against Harvey Weinstein. Despite never working with Weinstein, Hanks expressed his disgust and shock at the allegations.\n\nWhen asked why Hollywood ‚Äúsheltered‚Äù Weinstein despite rumors of his inappropriate behavior, Hanks rejected the excuse that his behavior could be considered old-fashioned. He asked, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs a really good question and isn‚Äôt it part and parcel to all of society somehow, that people in power get away with this?‚Äù\n\nHanks emphasized that power in Hollywood can be rather manipulative. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can,‚Äù the actor said.\n\n‚ÄúThey think their achievements entitle them,‚Äù Hanks said, proceeding to reference a quote about power. ‚ÄúSomebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: ‚ÄòWhen you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are,'‚Äù Hanks said.\n\nHanks agrees with the quote, saying he supports the negative backlash against the movie mogul. ‚ÄúI would say, there‚Äôs an example of how that‚Äôs true. Just because you‚Äôre rich and famous and powerful doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away ‚Äòfat,'‚Äù Hanks said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not, you know, I‚Äôm not the first person to say Harvey‚Äôs a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey ‚Äî I‚Äôm not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn‚Äôt it kind of amazing that it took this long? I‚Äôm reading it and I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don‚Äôt do that. That ain‚Äôt fair. Not her, come on. Come on!‚Äù\n\nHanks also commented on the sexism that continues to exist within Hollywood, referring to the show Mad Men, to which he says ‚Äúhad absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period.‚Äù He explained, ‚ÄúThose people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, ‚ÄòHey, wait, that‚Äôs going on today? Shouldn‚Äôt we be on this?‚Äô Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it‚Äôs happening? I can‚Äôt quite believe that.‚Äù\n\nThe actor joins other Hollywood stars, such as Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Patricia Arquette, Leonardo DiCaprio, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Lawrence, in speaking out against Weinstein. The backlash against Weinstein includes him being suspended by BAFTA, fired from The Weinstein Co., and having his $5 million endowment rejected, intended for USC‚Äôs School of Cinematic Arts ability to grant scholarships to female directors. A criminal investigation has also been opened by the New York Police Department.",

With over 435 episodes, Grey's Anatomy has surpassed even The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, which ran for 15 seasons and 435 episodes. Only seven dramas in the history of television have had more seasons than Grey's, including Gunsmoke, Law & Order, NCIS, CSI, and ER.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made official at the wrap party for the Shonda Rhimes drama, where ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey praised the show's loyal fans and the new generations of viewers who continue to discover the joy and drama of Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made possible thanks to a new two-year deal signed by star Ellen Pompeo, who remains the highest-earning actress on a drama series. The deal includes a seven-figure signing bonus, two full backend equity points on the show, and producing fees on both the flagship series and spinoff Station 19.\n\nGrey's Anatomy has become increasingly important for ABC since creator Shonda Rhimes left her longtime home at ABC Studios for a nine-figure deal with Netflix. Rhimes has since handed off day-to-day control of the show to Krista Vernoff, who has helped creatively recharge the series and Pompeo.\n\nThe current 14th season ranks as ABC's No. 1 drama among the advertiser-coveted adults 18-49 demographic and No. 2 at the network among total viewers. With Pompeo, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson, and James Pickens Jr. all set to return for season 15, along with co-stars Kevin McKidd, Jesse Williams, Caterina Scorsone, Camilla Luddington, Kelly McCreary, Giacomo Gianniotti, Sarah Drew, and Jessica Capshaw, Grey's Anatomy is set to continue its reign as the longest-running primetime drama in history.\n\nGrey's Anatomy joins a roster of ABC shows set to return for 2018-19, including comedies The Goldbergs, Modern Family, and Roseanne, as well as the previously renewed Good Doctor. Those join new pickups including the 1990s-set Goldbergs spinoff, Nathan Fillion drama The Rookie, and Take Two, with the latter likely set for this summer.",

The director, Taika Waititi, shows promise, but I believe the writers could have done better in their attempts to alter the series' tone and create a coherent narrative. The fanbase was overly hyped about the film, and while it was amusing, it wasn't as funny as Guardians of the Galaxy. The characters' behavior deviated from their established personalities, and the pacing felt rushed. The Sakaar sequences detracted from the movie's backstory on Asgard, and I wish more had been shown of Hela. Odin's scene was also somewhat absurd.\n\nValkyrie is fine, but I don't like the portrayal as a drunk. It's a cliche, and it doesn't accurately reflect the character. I love her chemistry with Bruce, and I hope their relationship continues in future installments. There doesn't seem to be any romantic tension between Valkyrie and Thor, which is fine.\n\nLoki was the butt of jokes and seemed to lack his usual depth. He wasn't entirely in line with his previous characterization, and I question his relevance to the story. If Marvel doesn't give him a clear purpose beyond satisfying fans, his contract may not be renewed. I wouldn't be surprised if he's 'killed' off in Infinity War and then brought back to life in Avengers 4, perhaps as Kid Loki or Agent of Asgard Loki as Marvel introduces new Avengers members and seeks to reboot the franchise.\n\nI enjoyed the dynamic between Bruce and Thor, and I don't like the forced inclusion of the Black Widow scene. I would prefer to see more scenes featuring Valkyrie and Bruce. The events of the movie left me feeling like I was watching a fan fiction or side story. While it may be entertaining, it doesn't align with the tone I would like to see in future sequels. Despite the positive reception from critics and fans, I'm in the minority on this opinion.\"",

The news quickly spread and caused a stir, as cohost Kelly Ripa was absent from the show for two consecutive days. During this time, actress Ana Gasteyer filled in for Ripa and stood by as Strahan made the announcement. Reports of behind-the-scenes drama began to surface, and many are curious about what exactly happened.\n\nThere have been rumors about a rift between Strahan and Ripa, with sources claiming that they have not been getting along recently. Strahan has been a contributing correspondent on Good Morning America for approximately two years, and Ripa felt blindsided by the news of his departure. According to a source close to Ripa, she said in a meeting, \"Didn't I tell you this was going to happen? . . . I told you two years ago this was going to happen.\"\n\nRipa's absence after the news broke seemed partially planned and partially not. ABC and her publicist claimed that the absence was tied to a preplanned vacation, but Kelly's vacation was not previously mentioned. Ripa dropped a subtle message after the news broke, carrying a copy of a book called David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants. It is speculated that this may be a coincidence.\n\nRipa has also initiated complete radio silence with Strahan, reportedly not acknowledging him and refusing to discuss any plans with ABC executives. Strahan's final show has been set for May 13, and he will leave the show in May instead of staying through the summer. Ripa spoke out about Strahan's exit in People, saying that she can understand why he might have made an \"oversight\" not to inform her of his departure. She also said that they are like a family, and sometimes \"when you are so comfortable with somebody, you may not give them the same consideration as somebody you're not as comfortable with‚Äîa certain formality falls away.\"",

The British actor Michael Sheen and the comedian Sarah Silverman, known for their shared anti-populist views, have called it quits after four years of being in a relationship. According to Sheen, their passion for politics was what ultimately led to their separation.\n\nSheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the '30s, told the Daily Telegraph that the Brexit referendum was what inspired him to become more politically active. However, their desire to make a difference in the world led them to take different paths. Silverman, an American, wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, while Sheen, a Welshman, wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.\n\n\"We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions‚Äîbecause she is American and I‚Äôm Welsh,\" Sheen explained. \"After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.\"\n\nDespite the difficult decision to part ways, both Sheen and Silverman acknowledge that each of them had to do what they needed to do. Sheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales, aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.\n\nAs the Telegraph puts it, \"Sheen sounds a little wistful\" about the impact that politics had on his love life. The emotional weight of this political divide has once again reminded us that love and politics are not mutually exclusive, but sometimes they can pull us in opposite directions.",

From the dress that divided the world to the \"hot felon\" who became a global sensation, these are the moments that broke the internet in a way that no other could.\n\nThe dress that divided the world\n\nOn February 26, 2015, a tweet featuring a close-up photo of a dress went viral, sparking a heated debate about its color. The dress was actually a blue and black bandage dress from British retailer Roman Originals, but people saw it as gold and white or blue and black. The debate raged on for days, with 7.6 million tweets and a surge in traffic to Roman Originals' site. The retailer sold out of the original black and gold dress in 34 minutes and eventually sold a white and gold version in support of British charity Comic Relief.\n\nApril the Giraffe's birth\n\nIn the spring of 2017, all eyes were on April, a pregnant giraffe at Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York. The live-streaming camera set up in April's habitat captivated viewers as she gave birth to calf Tajiri on April 15, 2017. The live stream garnered more than 232 million live views on YouTube over a seven-week period.\n\nThe \"yanny\" or \"laurel\" debate\n\nIn May 2018, a bizarre recording of the word \"laurel\" split the internet in two. While some heard the word \"laurel,\" others clearly heard \"yanny,\" and nobody could agree on who was right. The audio clip was from an online dictionary entry, and the differing interpretations of the clip all had to do with how the brain interprets sound frequencies.\n\nJeremy Meeks, the \"hot felon\"\n\nIn June 2014, the Stockton Police Department released a mugshot of Jeremy Meeks, a 30-year-old inmate arrested on a weapons charge. Meeks' chiseled jaw and piercing eyes quickly made him a global sensation, and he was dubbed the \"hot felon.\" Meeks signed to a modeling agency and has since worked around the world.\n\nBeyonc√©'s pregnancy announcement\n\nWhen Beyonc√© makes an announcement, the world stops to listen, and her early morning pregnancy announcement was no different. Pregnant with twins, Queen Beyonc√© posted a photo to Instagram in the wee hours of February 1, 2017, announcing that the Carter-Knowles family was \"blessed two times over\" and would be growing their family by two. The announcement post earned more than 11 million likes, making it one of the most-liked Instagram posts of all time.\n\nTrump's \"covfefe\" tweet\n\nOn May 31, 2017, President Trump tweeted, \"Despite the constant negative press covfefe.\" A screenshot of the now-deleted tweet shows Trump's use of \"covfefe\" in an apparent typo. The word became a catchphrase of sorts that spawned T-shirts, hashtags, and even a license plate. The baffling term even lent its name to a legislative proposal from U.S. Rep Mike Quigley. If enacted, the COVFEFE Act (Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act) would have required the National Archives to keep records of the president's tweets.\n\nKim Kardashian's Paper magazine cover\n\nIn 2017, Kim Kardashian's bare-all cover of Paper magazine brought the phrase \"break the internet\" into the public lexicon. The magazine unveiled two covers shot by Jean-Paul Goude that feature the reality star, including one where she bares all. In the second photo, a recreation Goude's \"Champagne Incident\" photograph from the 1960s, Kardashian is popping open a bottle of champagne that has fountained over her head and into a glass balanced on her derriere.\n\nThe ALS Ice Bucket Challenge\n\nIn 2014, the ALS Association's Ice Bucket Challenge swept the web, d",

With estimated net worths of over $100 million, it's hard to imagine the amount of hard work and dedication that has gone into his success.\n\nBut what exactly does Wade make his money from? The answer is simple: basketball and massive paychecks. Since joining the NBA in 2003-2004, Wade has made over $136 million playing the game he loves. His current contract pays him $15 million this season, with another $16.1 million due next season if he opts-in to his player option.\n\nBut Wade's success doesn't stop there. Along with LeBron James, Wade has mastered the art of taking short-term contracts to increase his flexibility and secure larger annual contracts. In 2014, he signed a two-year, $31.1 million contract with a player option, setting him up to be a free agent when the salary cap increases in 2016-2017. And when that time comes, Wade will be set to cash in on the biggest paydays of his career.\n\nHowever, even with all of his accomplishments, Wade was only the 21st highest-paid player in the NBA last year, according to ESPN. He made far less than players like Joe Johnson, Rudy Gay, and Brook Lopez. But that's not reason to feel bad for Wade, though. He's made tens of millions more in sponsorship deals, including a high-profile deal with a sports brand in China.\n\nOver the years, Wade has had sponsorship deals with Converse and Nike, but his biggest deal was with Chinese shoe company Li Ning. In 2012, he signed a 10-year deal with the company that few consumers know in the U.S., but which will pay him millions annually along with a reported $60 million stake in the company. It was a high-risk move for both Li Ning and Wade, and it's uncertain if it's paying off. Li Ning just reported its third straight year of losses, and its stock has gone almost nowhere since Wade signed the deal.\n\nOn top of Li Ning, Wade has had slightly less lucrative deals with Gatorade, Pepperidge Farm, Mission, and other brands. In total, Forbes estimates that he made $12 million in sponsorships last year.\n\nAdd it all up, and Dwyane Wade has made well over $200 million in his career. But after paying agents, managers, and living expenses, his net worth is likely significantly less than that. Estimates of his net worth are between $95 million and $115 million, and he has millions more coming in future years.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, Dwyane Wade has built a huge net worth and he'll likely add to it in years to come. And for those who have followed his career, it's clear that his success is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and willingness to take risks.",

Upon arrival, I discovered that the parlor floor, despite the unseasonable heat outside, was warmed by a roaring fire. As I waited, I realized that I was sitting in Harvey Weinstein's living room. He had purchased the six-story house in 2006, before marrying Chapman, and she had since transformed it with her style. The black floors and white rugs, chinoiserie, gilt, and glass, hydrangeas in a vase, and a Jo Malone candle completed the ambiance.\n\nA few weeks earlier, I had met Chapman at the Marchesa fashion company atelier, where she co-owns the business with Keren Craig. She appeared nervous and uncomfortable, mentioning that she had not been out in public for five months since similar accusations against her husband were made public. Today, she was more relaxed, though there was a sense of gallows humor. When I mentioned the warm weather, she quipped, \"Think of all the poor plants that are going to spring out and then die.\"\n\nWe moved downstairs to the ground floor, which was a large, open space with modern furniture and surprising art. There was a spacious kitchen that overlooked the backyard, and a TV room where Chapman's son Dash was sitting on a sectional encircled by some kind of electronic device. At 42, Chapman looked younger than in photographs, perhaps because she was more goofy than I had imagined. Although she retained her British accent, she was more laid-back than I had expected.\n\nOur meeting took place in Chapman's soon-to-be-ex-townhouse that had recently been sold by her soon-to-be-ex-husband. It was meant to be the first time she publicly addressed what happened with her husband. However, the night before our meeting, she called me late and sounded worried, apologetic, and unsure of whether she was ready to address difficult questions.

For example, she was accused of breaking protocol by crossing her legs at a royal engagement and attempting to hold Prince Harry's hand in public, which is not typically done by members of the royal family. However, the Royal Family is giving her some slack as she is still a relatively new duchess.\n\nA palace insider told HollywoodLife.com that Meghan worries about making mistakes, as she wants to do everything perfectly. The insider also revealed that the Queen is actually very gracious towards Meghan and does not put any pressure on her. Prince Harry is also very supportive of Meghan and often tells her how amazing she is doing and how quickly she is learning.\n\nAt Meghan and Harry's royal wedding on May 18, Meghan sang \"God Save the Queen\" flawlessly and crossed her legs at her ankles. While her mistakes are understandable to the royal family, they can be devastating to Meghan, who is reportedly often in tears due to criticism from the British press. Prince Harry is said to be very protective of Meghan and is reminded of his mother, Princess Diana, who was also criticized by the press. He worries that nothing has really changed. However, if Meghan is anything like Diana, she will continue to handle herself with impeccable class.",

The couple was not allowed to marry in the Church of England, so they tied the knot at Windsor Town Hall before being blessed in St. George's Chapel, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be married on May 19.",

And yet, her latest song, \"Twice,\" has left some fans underwhelmed.\n\n\"Accelerate\" may be a decent track, but it pales in comparison to her classic hits like \"Dirrty\" and \"Your Body.\" However, \"Twice\" is a different story entirely. This emotional ballad is a return to basics for Christina, allowing her powerful vocals to shine without overwhelming the beautiful melodies.\n\nWhile it may not be as instantly memorable as \"Hurt,\" \"You Lost Me,\" or \"Beautiful,\" \"Twice\" is a gorgeous listen for those who appreciate ballads. The stripped-back intro and outro are particularly chilling moments that showcase Christina's true talent.\n\nWhat's clear is that we should expect the unexpected from Christina this time around. And with \"Twice\" available on Apple Music and Spotify, there's no doubt that this song will only get better with each listen.",

She's always loved the classic tune by Earth, Wind & Fire, and notes that the month of September is especially meaningful to one of her relationships. An added layer of sentiment came from being able to record the song in a Nashville studio, the city Taylor moved at age 14 to pursue country music.\" Spin has speculated on the reasons behind the edit, as well as Swift's alteration of the date in the song's opening line, which she changes from Sept. 21 to Sept. 28.\n\nSwift's comments on the other track remained unchanged in the press release: \"Delicate' is a song about the vulnerability that immediately surfaces in all of us the minute we meet someone we want to like us,\" it reads. \"We think about everything they might've heard about us, every reason they wouldn‚Äôt want us. Every step forward toward that other person scares us, but it thrills us too. 'Delicate' is about the balancing act of the rush and the fear and hoping it's really worth it to take that chance.\"\n\nThis isn't Swift's first foray into Spotify exclusives, as she released a \"Delicate\" vertical video in recent weeks. In 2014, Swift harshly criticized the service and removed her music from all streaming platforms over what she said were unfair royalty payments. She relented with Apple a few months later, and ultimately returned all of her albums to the major services in June of last year.

According to the Associated Press, Moore made the bold claim, \"I want Montana to be known as a decent state.\"\n\nDespite Moore's bizarre stance, the U.S. sales for yoga clothes have increased an astounding 45 percent year over year, while participation in yoga sports has only increased by a measly 4.5 percent. This means that more and more women are embracing athleisure wear as their go-to uniform, and for good reason - yoga pants are versatile, seasonless, and most importantly, comfortable.\n\nBut just because yoga pants are comfortable, doesn't mean they should be worn anywhere and everywhere. Here are some tips on how to wear yoga pants around town without getting the side-eye:\n\nDO: Learn from Lululemon's sheer pants recall. Make sure you select a pair that is truly opaque. Test them out in broad daylight or under bright lights.\n\nDON'T: Wear them to work. Ever. \"Dress Pant Yoga Pants\" is an oxymoron.\n\nDO: Invest in the correct size. It sounds like a no-brainer, but often women will purchase a size down to get a tighter fit or a longer shelf life since yoga pants stretch out. In reality, all you end up with is \"camel toe.\" Avoid at all costs.\n\nDON'T: Show your panty lines. If thongs aren't your thing, Commando and Zobha make great full-coverage bikini bottoms that are undetectable.\n\nDO: Layer up! Throwing on a leather jacket or a dark trench over your yoga pants and T-shirt will instantly dress up your look when you're running from bikram to brunch.\n\nDON'T: Keep wearing your favorite pair after the expiration date. Unlike jeans, yoga pants don't age well. Toss them when they're overly faded, stretched or ripped.\n\nDO: Accessorize! Nothing pulls together athleisure wear like a statement handbag and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nDON'T: Try to pull off your zaniest tie-dye yoga pants outside your ashtanga class. Stock up on neutral colors ‚Äî navy, black, charcoal ‚Äî that will go with anything.\n\nDO: Consider your tight-fitting yoga pants a thicker alternative to leggings in the wintertime. On the weekends, pair with knee-high boots and an oversized sweater, or wear them underneath a dress. No one will know the difference.\n\nTo shop the best yoga pants on the market, click on the slideshow below.",

The character was the boyfriend of Joyce Byers and a father figure to Will, and his death was witnessed by many characters, including Joyce, Sheriff Hopper, and the main group of friends.\n\nDespite Bob's newbie status, Astin's performance as the character had already won over the creators and the rest of the cast. The Duffer Brothers had originally planned for Bob to die earlier in the season, but they had to push it back until episode eight. The death scene was described as the central heartbreaker of the season and served as a pivot point to the finale.\n\nExecutive producer Shawn Levy stated that hiring Astin was not initially a problem, as he believed Astin was an incredible actor and the part was not just about his past association with The Goonies. Levy added that the death scene was the hardest to write because of the emotional impact it had on the characters and the audience.\n\nAlthough Bob's death has not yet been avenged, the Duffers believe that the story will continue to unfold in its own way. They have not ruled out the possibility of Bob's fans taking up arms for \"Justice for Bob\" in the upcoming season.",

They claimed that Weinstein's alleged unwanted sexual advances occurred on a single day and consisted of asking her to give him a massage, asking her to help him pick out clothes, and asking her to watch him shower.\n\nIn response to the motion to dismiss, Judd's attorney Theodore Boutrous Jr. said that \"Mr. Weinstein's arguments seeking to escape the consequences of his despicable misconduct are not only baseless, they are offensive.\"\n\nJudd, 50, was among the first women to go public with allegations against Weinstein, who faces criminal sexual assault charges in New York and has been named in several other sexual harassment lawsuits.",

Jason Phillips, CEO of the Friant Water Authority, noted that recent rainfall had not solved the long-standing problem of nearly a decade of drought. He also mentioned that a canal that runs from Fresno to north of Bakersfield had sunk in some places as much as 2 feet in two years, causing issues with the system that operates on the force of gravity.\n\nThe meeting was also an opportunity for Harris to convince Central Valley representatives of her interest in issues beyond her base in Alameda and San Francisco counties. Harris is seeking to be more like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has worked for two decades to aid the agricultural industry. However, Harris' predecessor, former Sen. Barbara Boxer, was more aligned with environmental groups, which has led to a negative view of her in the Central Valley.\n\nSome participants lobbied Harris for her support of dams that have long been under consideration by federal and state officials, particularly the Temperance Flat Dam, which would be constructed on the San Joaquin River. Harris offered no assurances on the topic, and speaking to reporters after the meeting, she said she would advocate for farmers during the crafting of a new farm bill and other measures before the Senate.\n\nWilliam Bourdeau, executive vice president of the influential Harris Farms, wished that Harris' urban supporters had a \"better understanding\" of the risks and challenges of farming.

However, it seems that their love has run its course.\n\nFassbender has a history of dating his co-stars, having been involved with his X-Men: First Class co-star Zoe Kravitz from 2010 to 2011, and with his Shame co-star Nicole Beharie. Vikander, on the other hand, has been cast in several high-profile films, including Burnt and the upcoming Bourne movie.\n\nDespite the end of their relationship, both Fassbender and Vikander are reportedly doing well in their respective careers. Fassbender will reprise his role of Steve Jobs in the upcoming film Steve Jobs, and Vikander will appear opposite Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller in Burnt.\n\nWhile the break-up is undoubtedly sad news, it is not the first Hollywood romance to end this year. Other high-profile couples, such as Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert, and Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith, have also announced their separations.\n\nAs for Fassbender and Vikander's reported split, it is not the first time that the couple have been rumored to be dating. In the past, they have been spotted together at various events, but have never confirmed their relationship.\n\nOverall, we wish both Fassbender and Vikander the best of luck in their future endeavors.",

The bill passed with a narrow margin, 217-213, and was met with criticism from numerous Hollywood stars who took to Twitter to voice their opinions against the bill.\n\nThe Republican-backed measure will keep children on family policies until age 26 but will also cut the Medicaid program for low-income people and end tax penalties in the Affordable Care Act on the health industry and those who earn high-paying salaries. The bill will also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year and allows states to get waivers to free insurers from coverage requirements, which could cause them to charge people with pre-existing illnesses higher rates than they charge healthy customers.\n\nIn response to the bill's passage, President Trump expressed confidence in the bill's success and stated that it was a repeal and replace of Obamacare. However, many people, including Jimmy Kimmel and George Takei, expressed their views on equal healthcare for those with pre-existing conditions, such as their newborn son.\n\nThe hashtag #IAmAPreexistingCondition quickly became a trending topic, and America Ferrera, Sarah Hyland, Mark Ruffalo, and George Takei were among those who expressed their views on Twitter. The bill now heads to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain.",

Kidman's career in Australia would continue for a few more years, as she worked in both movies and TV.\n\nBut it was her international breakout role in 1989's Dead Calm that would change the course of her life. She portrayed the wife of a naval officer in the thrilling Australian thriller, and it was this movie that caught the attention of audiences worldwide and launched her into American cinema.\n\nHer arrival to the American movie industry was in the film Days of Thunder in 1990, where she met Tom Cruise, who would become her husband.

They appeared together at the Academy Awards in 1991, where Kidman earned her first-ever Golden Globe nomination for her role in the film Billy Bathgate.\n\nHowever, their marriage was not meant to last.

Johnson, who was interviewed by Mic, explained that she needed the money to support her family and that she had been through a difficult period in her life. Kardashian was moved by the interview and expressed her support for Johnson on social media.\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump released a photograph of himself and Kardashian in the Oval Office, which was met with media scrutiny and criticism. The New York Post, for example, featured a joke about Kardashian's rear end on its Thursday cover, and the image was retweeted and liked thousands of times.\n\nThe response to Kardashian's request for a presidential pardon highlights the differences in how male and female leaders are perceived in society. Trump, as a male reality television star, is perceived as an alpha male who never backs down and is not afraid to accept criticism. Kardashian, as a female reality television star, is perceived as a glamorous and ageless icon who is often treated as a joke, despite her significant influence and ability to draw attention to important causes.\n\nWhile celebrities often use their platform to draw attention to important issues, Kardashian's involvement in prison reform was met with skepticism and criticism from some experts in the field. Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, expressed her concerns that Kardashian did not bring the necessary expertise and experience to tackle the complex issue of prison reform on a national scale.\n\nOverall, the response to Kardashian's request for a presidential pardon highlights the double standards that exist in society when it comes to male and female leaders and the importance of considering the qualifications and experience of those who take up important causes.",

Actually, we called it off.\"\n\nMcQueen, named after his grandfather, Steve McQueen, had announced the engagement news to Silva on Instagram in January, sharing a photo of the two holding hands and sharing a kiss, giving fans a glimpse of her new engagement ring. Silva reposted the photo on her own Instagram account, captioning it, \"My best friend, love of my life‚Ä¶YES, yes yes a million times over.\"\n\nHowever, the last photo of McQueen on Silva's account dates back to January 1, and both posts have since been deleted. It's unclear what caused the split or whether the couple plans to remain friends.\n\nBefore getting engaged, the couple had been dating for over a year. McQueen is best known for playing Jeremy Gilbert on The Vampire Diaries from 2009-15, and he has also starred in Chicago Fire and Chicago P.D.\n\nWhile many fans are heartbroken by the news, we hope that both McQueen and Silva find happiness in the future.",

        "content": "The biggest fashion faux pas for a wedding guest would be to upstage the bride. With all the attention and speculation surrounding Kate Middleton's gown for her upcoming royal wedding, it would be nearly impossible to do. However, there are other unwritten rules that guests should consider. Don't wear white, anything too revealing, or a hat that is too wide or tall to block the view of the person behind you. You can wear tasteful black, and be sure to cover your arms.\n\n\"This is not a place to make a fashion statement for yourself,\" said Sally Kilbridge, deputy editor of Brides magazine. She goes on to list more don'ts, including no miniskirts, plunging necklines, and novelty socks, which have become a surprising trend among guests at American weddings. The attire worn to a British royal wedding is appropriate daytime wedding attire kicked up many notches, Kilbridge said. Everyone's outfit should be chic, elegant, and suit the very formal, traditional occasion while not letting glitzy, black-tie, eveningwear trappings creep in.\n\nDesigner Reem Acra thinks Westminster Abbey could be the place for cocktail frocks, especially for celebrities and fashion editors who have long found reason to wear them before noon. The fashion role model for older women should be well-cut, luxe-fabric skirt suits, while Middleton's younger friends could pull off slightly retro, Hitchcock-inspired sheaths or pencil skirts paired with nipped-waist jackets. George Kotsiopoulos, co-host of E!'s Fashion Police, expects a lot of hats, but hopes they'll be toned-down cloches or a pillbox with a veil.\n\nVivien Sheriff, a British milliner who has made several dozen custom headpieces for wedding guests, said many guests will follow the lead of Middleton's mother, Carole, who is a fan of substantial hats. The hats Sheriff has made feature some feathers and crystals, but they're not oversized. \"You can't show off too much. You don't want to overdo it, but there is a lot of expression in the headpieces.\" Sheriff added that people aren't going to want to hide their faces, so the brims won't cover them. \"This way, everyone can get good photos and you can greet other guests looking them in the eye.\"\n\nThere will be more black than one might expect, Sheriff said. She had more orders for black than she expected. \"I guess fashion has changed and a lot of young guests want to wear black.\" However, black is fine as long as it's not funereal, according to Brides' Kilbridge, although the Middleton family won't wear it. Prince Charles' wife, Camilla, won't wear it either, Kilbridge predicted. Camilla will likely pluck something she already had in her closet, Kilbridge said, probably something not unlike the tailored dress and lovely coat she wore to her own wedding.\n\nMost of the male guests will likely don a navy or gray morning suit, which is basically the daytime equivalent of a tuxedo including a vest or waistcoat. All of William's military friends will be in uniform, Kilbridge said. A guest with a well-known personal style has a little more flexibility, said Kilbridge. It would be perfectly acceptable for Elton John, for example, to wear a flashy, embroidered vest under his jacket. Fashion fans will be eager to see David and Victoria Beckham, and Kilbridge thinks they won't disappoint, although she wonders how Victoria Beckham will dress her baby bump. \"They've had some crazy fashion moments, but this won't be one of them. She'll probably look fantastic. They want to create the impression that she belongs there. I think most people will be striving to look like they belong.\" That might have singer Joss Stone, who is famously barefoot almost everywhere she goes, digging to the bottom of her closet looking for a pair of shoes.",

I will love you more and more everyday Until the end of time ‚ôö,\" she wrote.\n\nHowever, as always, the internet had other plans. Khlo√©'s followers couldn't help but leave some unnecessary and rude comments, completely missing the point of the post. One user even joked about the possibility of Instagram being without editing apps, leaving Khlo√© to respond with a heartfelt message about the importance of kindness and positivity.\n\n\"would you keep IG if all photo editing apps were gone forever???

He is definitely a king üëë it is a shame that can respect us for respecting his privacy. You should not comment if you truly aren't informed about our family,\" she replied.\n\nKhlo√©'s message is clear: trolls will not come for her without facing the consequences. She will stand up for her loved ones and defend her own worth, no matter what.\n\nIt's important to remember that Khlo√© is more than just a reality TV star. She is a mother, a daughter, and a woman who deserves to be treated with kindness and respect. Let's all take a moment to reflect on the impact our words and actions can have, and strive to be more like Khlo√© in the New Year.",

These headlines have painted her as a \"crazy and manipulative\" estranged wife who is \"out for blood\" in the divorce fight and wants to \"embarrass and punish\" Brad by portraying him as a deadbeat dad. Furthermore, Page Six reported that Jolie had developed an \"insane jealousy\" of Amal Clooney, which caused her to believe that Amal has stolen her identity as the world's most glamorous and admired humanitarian.\n\nDespite these negative headlines, Jolie also published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency's efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children. The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.\n\nIn her piece, Jolie shared moving accounts of what education means to children whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war. She met these girls during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can't read or write, and has been \"robbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.\"\n\nJolie argues that wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war by providing resources such as school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps. She concludes that helping refugees in a \"patient, long-term manner, guided by our values\" is the wise and morally right course of action.",

According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Jolie could lose primary custody of the children if she fails to improve their relationship with their father. The judge emphasized the importance of each child having a healthy and strong relationship with both parents, and Pitt's access to and relationship with the children. The new guidelines aim to \"figure out what's in the children's best interest,\" and include a detailed summer visitation schedule and unmonitored phone access between Pitt and each of the kids. The goal is to slowly acclimatize the kids to Pitt's presence in their lives. Both Jolie and Pitt have yet to respond to a request for comment.",

Selena and Abel's love was so apparent that it was hard not to be caught up in their romance.\n\nBut despite the love that was clearly in the air, there were moments of separation anxiety. The Weeknd took a break from Selena to hit the stage for a duet, and it's unclear if they both felt a pang of longing for each other.\n\nMeanwhile, Selena's ex Bella Hadid was elsewhere, spending the weekend in Dubai with friends. It's possible that she was trying to avoid the public displays of affection between Selena and The Weeknd, or maybe she just isn't a fan of festivals.\n\nRegardless, the love between Selena and Abel was undeniable, and their Instagram posts confirmed it.

The women stood together in solidarity, calling for greater representation and equal opportunities in the film industry.\n\nIn a joint statement, Blanchett and French director Agnes Varda emphasized the need for transparency and parity in executive bodies and work environments. They called for governments to enforce equal pay laws and for workplaces to be diverse and equitable. The women also acknowledged the efforts of those standing for change and called for the industry's stairways to be accessible to all.\n\nThe protest was part of the 5050x2020 movement, which seeks to achieve gender parity across all aspects of the film industry by the year 2020. The number 82 was selected to match the number of films directed by women in the festival's history, with only 4.3% of competition films in the past 71 years being directed by women.\n\nOther notable women involved in the protest included Salma Hayek, Marion Cotillard, director Patty Jenkins, and Haifaa al-Mansour. The protest was organized by French group Le Deuxieme Regard and the 5050x2020 collective, in collaboration with the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe protest comes in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #MeToo and Time's Up movements, which have sparked a renewed demand for change in the film industry. The movement also echoes broader calls for gender equality and diversity in the workplace.\n\nWhile progress has been made in recent years, with more women making the cut in competition, the statistics for women in Cannes are still dismal. Only one woman has won the Palme d'Or, and only one woman has been named Best Director. The festival has been criticized for its lack of diversity and inclusion, and for failing to provide a platform for women filmmakers.\n\nHowever, the rise of women in the film industry is undeniable, and the protest at Cannes highlights the need for continued efforts to promote gender equality and diversity in the industry. As the movement continues to gain momentum, it remains to be seen what concrete actions will be taken to address these issues and create a more inclusive and equitable film industry.",

In a series of tweets on August 29, Haynes criticized the industry for placing too much emphasis on actors' personal lives and not enough on their talent.\n\n\"Hollywood is so f**ked up,\" he wrote. \"So much of the focus is on your personal life & has nothing to do with the talent you have to bring to the table.\"\n\nHe then praised American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy, Arrow executive producer Greg Berlanti, and Teen Wolf creator Jeff Davis for giving him opportunities and recognizing that being gay is more than just a part of his personal life. \"Thank god for Ryan Murphy, Greg Berlanti, & Jeff Davis,\" Haynes tweeted. \"They believe gay actors are more than just their personal lives.\"\n\nHaynes, who came out as gay in 2016 and is engaged to celebrity floral designer Jeff Leatham, has previously spoken about the struggles he faced in Hollywood due to his sexuality. He revealed that people in the industry had advised him to hide his relationship, and that he was even set up with girls for press.\n\nHowever, Haynes is no longer alone in his fight for LGBTQ+ representation in Hollywood. He is grateful for the showrunners who embrace people's personal lives and their truth, and he is excited to see the change that is happening in the industry.\n\n\"So disappointed in how Hollywood can't understand that playing a character has nothing to do with how u live your personal life,\" Haynes wrote. \"But not anymore. You have all these amazing showrunners who actually embrace people's personal lives and embrace people's truth.\"\n\nHaynes' message is a powerful reminder that everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserves to be treated with respect and recognized for their talent. It is a message that we all need to hear, and it is one that we should all strive to live by.",

The news surprised fans who had been speculating about the couple's potential divorce for months.\n\nAccording to a report by Radar Online, several factors contributed to the decision to end their marriage. One of these was Tatum's desire to have more children. Despite being the parents of a daughter, Everly, Tatum reportedly wanted a larger family. However, Dewan was not on board with this idea. A previous report by OK! Magazine suggested that Dewan wanted to return to acting and that caring for a newborn would interfere with her plans.\n\nAnother factor in the separation was reportedly the couple's differing views on family life. Although Tatum was earning enough money to support the family, he wanted Dewan to be at home with Everly so she would not be raised by nannies. However, Dewan reportedly grew tired of being a housewife while Tatum spent his time on movie sets.\n\nAdditionally, jealousy is said to have played a role in the separation. As Tatum's fame increased with films such as 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, and its sequels, he became a sex symbol in Hollywood, attracting numerous women. Sources claim that Dewan was uncomfortable with the way Tatum interacted with fans, including flirting with them in front of her.\n\nIn an official statement released via social media, Tatum and Dewan announced their separation and stated that they would not be making further comments on the matter.",

Many muses have become partners or wives, such as Ingrid Bergman with Roberto Rossellini and Anna Karina with Jean-Luc Godard. However, the muse model is not always a straightforward relationship, as the French director Leos Carax admitted in an interview about the film Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, where his then lover Juliette Binoche starred. Carax dreamed of someday directing a film and having a beautiful girlfriend, and he admits that he did not know Binoche well.\n\nDespite the challenges in the artist-muse relationship, it can also be a source of strength, as Nina Hoss, who has worked with the German director Christian Petzold on six films, believes. Hoss thinks that difference is a source of strength and that Petzold chooses women for his characters because it gives him some distance, making the relationship interesting and surprising.\n\nOverall, the relationship between directors and actors can be complex and ever-evolving, and it is important to understand the dynamics at play in order to appreciate the work that these creative professionals produce.",

And it's not just Alba who appreciates this. Many moms have praised Target for creating a welcoming and comfortable space for nursing mothers.\n\nAlba, who is also a mom to Honor Marie, 9, and Haven Garner, 6, has been open about breastfeeding her 7-week-old son.

But she knows that it's important to maintain her own sense of self and to just do the best she can.\n\n‚ÄúAny mom who all of the sudden has little people that rely heavily on them for survival needs to maintain her own sense of self,‚Äù Alba told TODAY. ‚ÄúYou need to cut yourself some slack and bite off what you can chew. Things will be compromised and you just have to be okay with that.‚Äù\n\nAlba's hope for her kids is simple - that they are happy and that they are developing a positive relationship with the world around them.\n\n‚ÄúI just pray that my kids are happy,‚Äù the strong mom said back in 2015. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre giggling more than they‚Äôre crying, and if they‚Äôre curious and talkative, then I know they‚Äôre good.‚Äù\n\nThis is just one example of the many ways that moms are doing their best to balance their own needs with the needs of their little ones. And it's a reminder that we should all be supportive of each other, no matter what stage of motherhood we are in.\"",
