He is still protected by 'family members' in Brazil. They've told lies to papers to try to silence me. To finally speak out and not be afraid. To everyone still suffering silently, you never asked for it. NOBODY DOES. I do this for my son. So that he will see one day that we all have a voice. And that this behavior can not be tolerated any longer.\"\n\nThe actress, who plays Effy Stonem in the show, revealed that she kept her assault a secret for a decade, only sharing her story with her son.\n\nBut in a recent interview with Metro.Co.UK, Scodelario revealed that the response to her bravery had been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nShe said: \"The response was wonderful. I am now dealing with a new side of it, which is this. I will be asked about it forever now. I hope it doesn't define me but it will always be under my name and I accept that ‚Äì but I am proud I was brave enough to do it and I am grateful for the support I had from friends.\"\n\nScodelario also revealed that her 12-year-old self was the driving force behind her decision to speak out.\n\nShe said: \"I remember thinking that if I was 12-years-old and I had this horrific thing happen to me but I saw a woman I admired speaking up about it, it would have made me feel less guilty, and it would have inspired me to think 'this won't hold me back, this is something that has happened but I am not a victim.' So I thought if I can do that for one person then I owe it to my 12-year-old self.\"\n\nScodelario joins a growing list of women who have bravely come forward with their own stories of abuse, as the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across the world.\n\nActress Michelle Williams brought #MeToo founder Tarana Burke to the Golden Globes and opened up about navigating the uncertain times to help create a better world for the next generation, including her own 12-year-old daughter, Matilda Rose Ledger.\n\n\"I thought I would have to raise my daughter to learn how to protect herself in a dangerous world, but I think the work that Tarana has done and the work that I'm learning how to do ‚Äî we actually have the opportunity to hand our children a different world,\" Williams said on the E! red carpet pre-show. \"I am honored beyond measure to be standing next to this woman.

Just like his mom, Meghan, Guy has been on an incredible journey.\n\nBefore Meghan adopted him in 2015, he was on the verge of being put down by a shelter in Kentucky.

Doherty brought him to an adoption event just outside Toronto, where Meghan was living while filming Suits. Little did they know, Meghan was one of the hopeful dog owners.\n\nGuy's journey didn't end there.

Perhaps hanging out with her new four-legged friend, Guy, has helped fill that hole.\n\nMeghan and Guy's bond is obvious, and it's clear that they have a special connection.

The actor, currently starring in the London revival of Tony Kushner's Pulitzer-winning drama Angels in America, stunned the crowd at the drag show Werq the World, where he joined forces with co-stars Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and Russell Tovey.\n\nAs the show unfolded, Garfield found himself on the stage during the \"Wig in a Box\" segment, where he and three other audience members were called upon to wear wigs of iconic singers and engage in a lip-syncing battle. With no hesitation, the 33-year-old Amazing Spider-Man star chose Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You,\" leaving the other competitors to lip-sync Cher, Dolly Parton, and Katy Perry.\n\nThe audience was left breathless as Garfield donned the curly brunette wig, throwing himself into the performance with a contagious energy. He even delighted the crowd with a back flip during the show. After the performance, Michelle Visage, the drag race panelist, shared a photograph of herself embracing Garfield and Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox, captioning it with pride, \"Andrew Garfield, you are my new friend, I am SO proud of you for not just lip syncing Whitney tonight in a wig no less, but for opening your mind and heart to all it has to offer.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Garfield has donned drag. In 2014, he stunned in a long blonde wig and a lace white dress for Arcade Fire's music video for \"We Exist.\" His bravery and willingness to embrace the unknown have earned him newfound respect and appreciation from fans around the world.",

Her brother Joe Gorga was there to cheer her on, and the whole family was thrilled with her impressive performance.\n\nTeresa's trainer, Tara Zito, expressed her pride in the reality star's achievement, writing on Instagram, \"So proud of @teresagiudice for stepping on stage today for her first time ever in the bikini division!\"\n\nWhile Teresa has been open about her workouts and transformation since leaving prison, she kept her participation in the bodybuilding competition a secret. However, her trainer had nothing but kind words for her, and her performance left a lasting impression on those who witnessed it.\n\nTeresa's husband, Joe, who is also serving a prison sentence for the same crimes, has also made significant changes to his body, losing 45 lbs. in prison. The couple, who have four daughters, are eagerly awaiting their reunion.",

On the drama side, The Handmaid's Tale, the freshman series that took home several awards in its first year, is once again in the running for Outstanding Drama Series. The grim, dystopian adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel was praised for its Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series. Additionally, the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series prize will be awarded to series star Elisabeth Moss, who has finally won an Emmy after seven prior nominations.\n\nOn the comedy side, the nominations field is crowded with eight series vying for the main prize. However, reigning champ Veep is missing as the show's final season was delayed while its star, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, underwent treatment for cancer. Among the contenders for the Outstanding Comedy Series throne are newcomer The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and the second season of Donald Glover's Atlanta. The rest of the Outstanding Comedy Series nominees include Barry, GLOW, Silicon Valley, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nWhile some shows were overlooked in certain categories, Killing Eve's star, Sandra Oh, made history as the first woman of Asian descent to be nominated for a Lead Actress Emmy.\n\nNBC will broadcast the 2018 Emmy Awards show live on Monday, with Saturday Night Live's Colin Jost and Michael Che hosting. The complete list of nominees can be found on the Emmys' website.\n\nAs the night of recognition approaches, let us take a moment to reflect on the emotional impact of television. From the laughter and tears that come with binge-watching a new show to the heartbreak and hope that comes with watching a character's journey unfold, television has the power to bring us together in a way that no other medium can.\n\nHere's to the winners and nominees of the 2018 Emmy Awards.

This specificity adds credibility to the report.\n\n2. **Plausibility**: Kendall Jenner and Anwar Hadid are public figures known for attending such events. The statement that they have been friends for several years and have attended similar events together aligns with their public personas and previous media coverage.\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**: The report mentions Anwar Hadid's recent split with Nicola Peltz, which is verifiable through previous media reports.\n\n4. **Uncertainty Acknowledgement**: The message acknowledges uncertainty regarding the nature of the relationship between Kendall and Anwar, indicating a balanced approach rather than making definitive claims.\n\nConsidering these points, the message appears credible and likely to be a real report based on the information provided.

This level of detail and specificity suggests that the information is based on an actual observation or report, rather than being a completely made-up story.\n\nAdditionally, the message acknowledges the ambiguity around whether this is a new romantic relationship, indicating a degree of caution and objectivity in the reporting. This suggests that the author is attempting to provide a balanced and factual account, rather than sensationalizing the situation.\n\nFurthermore, the mention of Anwar Hadid's previous relationship with Nicola Peltz adds plausibility to the report, as it provides relevant context and background information about one of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, the level of detail, the cautious wording, and the inclusion of relevant background information all contribute to the impression that this is more likely to be a real and accurate report, rather than a fabricated story. Based on this assessment, the veracity of the message is more likely to be true than false, so I would return a value of 1.",

In 2013, he even surprised fans by dressing up in full Loki regalia while promoting \"Thor: The Dark World.\" However, this year he appeared briefly on the panel and then left the convention as soon as it ended, without speaking to the media or interacting with fans.\n\nSome have speculated that Hiddleston's brief relationship with pop star Taylor Swift may have contributed to his decision to avoid the convention. The relationship was heavily criticized and reportedly hurt his Hollywood career, leading to speculation that he may have lost the opportunity to play James Bond.\n\nHiddleston has been keeping a low profile with fans and the media in recent months, which has led some to speculate about his emotional state. It is unclear what the future holds for Hiddleston's career, but his fans will no doubt be keeping an eye on his next move.",

It's generally considered a tabloid-style publication which may sensationalize or exaggerate stories.\n\n2. **Plausibility of Events**: Good Charlotte is a well-known band, and it's plausible that they could go on tour, especially if they have a new album (\"Generation Rx\"). The idea of celebrities influencing their spouses to tour is also within the realm of possibility.\n\n3. **Lack of Specific Evidence**: The message mentions struggling ticket sales but doesn't provide specific data or evidence (like actual ticket sales figures or venue capacities).

The subsequent mention of \"rumors of her pregnancy\" also fits the pattern of how celebrity news and speculation often unfolds in the media.\n\nThe message then goes on to report on Jenner's recent public appearance, providing specific details such as the date, the individuals she was accompanied by, and the fact that photographic evidence was published by a reputable entertainment news outlet (TMZ). This level of detail and corroboration with an external source lends credibility to the overall narrative.\n\nFurthermore, the message acknowledges the ambiguity surrounding Jenner's pregnancy status, noting that while her appearance may suggest she is pregnant, her past behavior and recent professional engagements (the Calvin Klein campaign) could also indicate otherwise. This balanced and nuanced approach to the reporting suggests a well-informed and objective perspective, rather than a sensationalized or fabricated account.\n\nOverall, the level of detail, the use of specific facts and dates, the reference to external sources, and the balanced treatment of the subject matter lead me to conclude that this message is more likely to be a real, factual report rather than a fabricated one.

According to a new interview with The Talk, Smith maintains that he never asked for the footage to be aired and that he had a conversation with Jeff Probst about how he wanted to handle his story.\n\nSmith explained that he was drawn to Survivor because of the show's integrity in storytelling, and that he only revealed his trans status later in the relationship. He had a chat with Probst and they agreed that how and when he would talk about his trans identity was up to him, not the show.\n\nBut after being outed by fellow contestant Jeff Varner, Smith says he had unprecedented autonomy in how he wanted to tell his story. He even wrote a personal essay about the incident and says he was proud of how he responded. Smith also believes that by sharing his story, something good can come of it and that maybe it won't happen to someone else.\n\nSo who really outed Zeke Smith? Smith's interview with The Talk doesn't give away who is responsible, leaving many questions unanswered. It seems that CBS should take some responsibility and do the same.\"",

The description of their attire, with Plaza wearing a Barbour jacket with a \"March for Our Lives\" sticker and Theroux wearing a Supreme hoodie with the text \"illegal business controls America,\" also seems plausible and adds to the authenticity of the report.\n\nAdditionally, the message acknowledges that Theroux and Plaza have been friends for some time, but this is the first time they have been photographed together, which suggests a new development in their relationship. The message also leaves the interpretation of the \"message\" Theroux is trying to send with this sighting open-ended, rather than making definitive claims.\n\nOverall, the level of detail and the nuanced approach to the potential relationship between Theroux and Plaza lead me to believe that this message is more likely to be a real report of a celebrity sighting and relationship speculation, rather than a completely fabricated story. Therefore, I would return a value of 1, indicating that the message is more likely to be real.",

The DC Entertainment series, which was axed in May, averaged a 1.3 rating among adults 18-49 and nearly 5 million viewers in its third season. Despite a massive fan campaign, Netflix has decided to revive the show for a fourth season, leaving many to wonder why such a beloved series was cancelled in the first place.\n\n\"Lucifer\" never really set the ratings afire, but it had a dedicated fan base that fought hard to keep the show alive. The series ended on a cliffhanger, leaving fans heartbroken and creators gutted. Creator Joe Henderson tweeted out that the axing \"fucking hurts,\" and star Tom Ellis tweeted that he was \"gutted\" by the cancellation.\n\nAs Netflix picks up the show, it is clear that the Peak TV era offers more choices where one outlet's miss is another's hit. It also is worth noting that Netflix didn't even have the SVOD rights to \"Lucifer\" - Hulu did - meaning that deal had to be reworked, similar to the way Amazon recently revived Syfy's \"The Expanse\" after having to renegotiate SVOD rights as the first three seasons were sold to Netflix.\n\nThis cancellation comes as Fox undergoes a dramatic shift amid its studio counterpart's pending sale to Disney (or Comcast). Gone are niche comedies like \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" and narrow dramas like \"Lucifer,\" as Fox plots a shift to broader audiences with a slate of procedurals and multicamera comedies.

She writes that she found a photo of Franken putting his hands on her breasts while she slept.\n\nFranken released a statement shortly after the accusations, apologizing to Tweeden and others involved in the tour, as well as to everyone who works for him and counts on him as an ally and champion of women. He stated that he respects women and does not respect men who do not, and that he will cooperate with an ethics investigation.\n\nTweeden's allegations come amid a growing wave of sexual misconduct scandals in Hollywood and beyond. In 2017, the New York Times and the New Yorker published investigative pieces accusing movie producer Harvey Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Other celebrities have since come forward with their own accounts of sexual misconduct.",

Tweeden's account is specific in detailing the incidents of unwanted kissing and groping, which adds credibility to her claims.

But what we do know, per a new E! report, is how Pippa, reportedly, has been preparing for the wedding.\n\nThe outlet claims that Pippa has undergone a \"strict bridal body boot camp,\" a three-month program run out of Grace Belgravia health club. The program, in its description, doesn't sound too different from an (intensive) gym membership that you might read about a famous person partaking in; the components include \"a personal trainer, skincare and leg toning treatments, plus yoga, pilates, spinning, cardio training, dance and meditation classes\" and \"the club also offers to arrange home deliveries of specialized healthy meals.\"\n\nOh, wait, there's also this, which sounds positively Paltrow-ian: \"The club also has a team of doctors and specialists who can help with anti-aging treatments including botox, peels, fillers, microdermabrasion and an assortment of laser treatments, as well as IV therapies.\" E! notes, of course, that it is \"unclear if Pippa has undergone such procedures.\"\n\nTheir source claims that Pippa has \"met with her PT about five times a week and mostly sticks to cardio and pilates.\" Per the source: \"She feels amazing. Her diet is the healthiest ever‚Äîshe hasn't even had a glass of wine in months. She's had facial treatments sometimes once a week or once a fortnight.\"\n\nThis truly is an impressive feat, as, just over the course of writing this post, we have finished off two glasses of wine and did not complete a single facial treatment.",

Scott Menaged, 40, operated a real estate investment business and retail furniture stores in Phoenix, Arizona, and had also appeared on the popular TV show.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona, Menaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme that involved embezzling millions of dollars in loans meant for real estate purchases. He also provided fake real estate purchase documents to conceal the fraud and used the embezzled money to support a lavish lifestyle, including travel, million-dollar homes, and luxury vehicles.\n\nWhen Menaged no longer had access to the embezzled funds, he orchestrated an elaborate identity theft scheme with the help of customers of his furniture stores. He used the personal identification information of recently deceased individuals and submitted fake credit applications from his furniture stores to various banks, resulting in more than $2 million in losses to the banks.\n\n\"Menaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme and brazenly stole from his victims ‚Äî their money, their identities, and ultimately their trust,\" said First Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth A. Strange in a prepared statement. \"Today's lengthy sentence is a fitting punishment for his egregious crimes.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow also ordered Menaged to pay victims more than $33.5 million in restitution. The investigation was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation.\n\nThis is a heart-wrenching story of a man who betrayed the trust of his victims and stole their identities to support his own luxurious lifestyle. It serves as a reminder to be cautious of financial scams and to protect ourselves and our loved ones from fraud.",

Others questioned the authenticity of the incident, while still others simply expressed their surprise at the incident.\n\nAccording to E! News, Kim was \"gagged and bound at her hands and feet, then handcuffed at gunpoint\" before the masked men stole over $10 million worth of jewelry from her. She reportedly begged for her life and mentioned that she had babies at home, but the robbers wrapped her mouth in tape and put her in the bathtub, thinking she was going to be killed.\n\nKim fled Paris after talking to the police and was accompanied by her bodyguard Pascal Duvier. Kanye West, Kim's husband, was performing at the Meadows Music and Arts Festival in New York during the incident and ended his set abruptly to inform the audience of the family emergency.\n\nSo far, no one from the Kardashian family has publicly spoken about the incident, though Kim's spokesperson, Ina Treciokas, said the reality star was \"badly shaken but physically unharmed.\"",

She notes that Prince William and Kate Middleton did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite their public divorce.

Meghan also has her own wealth as an actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode.\n\nIf Meghan and Harry divorce, negotiations would likely take place outside of court, as is the case with Diana's divorce.

Adam, Mandy, and Val did an unbelievable job at getting across some points they needed to get across, but from a place of nurture and of love and of expecting to see growth on the other end.\"\n\nThe kids have responded well to the critiques from the judges, and Fisher is proud of the progress they've made. \"I feel like it‚Äôs a little bit different with the adults,\" he says. \"You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel.

This theory is difficult to accept due to the limited cultural lexicon, which can only accommodate one theory per celebrity at a time.\n\nRecently, a theory emerged suggesting that Katy Perry admitted to being a cannibal in an interview on French radio earlier this year. While there is no audio evidence to support this claim, several websites have reported on wild-ass quotes attributed to the singer. According to these reports, Perry claimed that people in Hollywood view human meat as the best, but its \"gotten a bad rap\" due to \"squeamish Christians and their hypocritical virtues.\"\n\nDespite this theory, Perry has not denied it and has even included cannibalistic imagery in her music video \"Bon App√©tit.\" In the video, Perry is cooked in a giant, human-sized pot and served to other humans on a plate. Some fans believe the imagery is a metaphor for her own \"sexual liberation,\" but others think otherwise.\n\nThere have also been reports that Perry is part of a cannibalistic cult filled with other high-profile celebrities. One theory suggests that she has unaccounted for Twitter followers because she is part of a larger, more cannibalistic group.\n\nWhile these theories may be entertaining, it is important to approach them with a critical eye and not jump to conclusions without evidence.",

According to an NBC News insider, the atmosphere around Kelly has become so bad that producers are openly sniping at her.\n\nWhen Kelly mentioned Kotb's \"dark period\" without explaining it to viewers, NBC News staff members were horrified. Kotb and Guthrie fought back by mocking Kelly's awkward exchange with Jane Fonda during an interview. Fonda responded to Kelly's question about plastic surgery by lecturing her on the \"wrong time and place to ask that question.\" Kotb and Guthrie remembered and treasured Fonda's clap-back and made it clear that they knew Kelly's mistake.\n\nAs Kotb and Guthrie head to the Olympics to broadcast the Today show live, Gifford and Kelly will likely be affected. Gifford will be co-hosting without Kotb, while Kelly will remain in New York with \"no hour to host at all.\" As Kotb and Guthrie's popularity continues to rise, it remains to be seen if Kelly will be able to keep her position on the show.",

        "content": "The meteoric rise of Donald Trump and his seemingly unbeatable political prowess have left many experts stumped, seeking an explanation as to how this occurred. To fully understand this phenomenon, we must not only examine Trump himself, but also his devoted supporters, whose unwavering admiration and devotion to their unpredictable and often inflammatory leader baffles many.\n\nPsychologists and neuroscientists have provided numerous thought-provoking explanations for Trump's enduring support, but the accounts of these experts often vary greatly, sometimes overlapping and other times conflicting. However insightful these critiques may be, it is clear that further research and examination are needed to pinpoint the exact psychological and social factors driving this bizarre behavior.\n\nIn a recent review paper published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, UC Santa Cruz professor Thomas Pettigrew argues that five major psychological phenomena can help explain this exceptional political event.\n\n1. Authoritarianism: This refers to the advocacy or enforcement of strict obedience to authority, often at the expense of personal freedom. Those with authoritarian personality syndrome, a prevalent condition, often display aggression toward outgroup members, submissiveness to authority, resistance to new experiences, and a rigid hierarchical view of society. Trump's speeches, with their absolutist terms like \"losers\" and \"disasters,\" naturally appeal to those who prefer authoritarianism. Research has shown that Republican voters scored higher on measures of authoritarianism before Trump's rise, and a 2016 survey found that high authoritarians greatly favored Trump, leading to his election win.\n\n2. Social dominance orientation (SDO): This refers to people who prefer a societal hierarchy where high-status groups have dominance over low-status ones. Those with SDO are typically dominant, tough-minded, and driven by self-interest. Trump appeals to those with SDO by making clear distinctions between high-status groups (White) and low-status groups (immigrants and minorities). A survey found that those who scored high on both SDO and authoritarianism were those who intended to vote for Trump.\n\n3. Prejudice: While not all Trump supporters are prejudiced against ethnic and religious minorities, some certainly are. The Republican party has long used strategies that appeal to bigotry, such as \"dog whistles\" that signal prejudice to racists but not to others. Trump's shockingly direct appeals to bigoted supporters, such as calling Muslims \"dangerous\" and Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers,\" likely play a role in his popularity. A new study shows that support for Trump is correlated with a standard scale of modern racism.\n\n4. Intergroup contact: Contact with members of groups outside one's own has been shown to reduce prejudice. However, Trump's white supporters have experienced significantly less contact with minorities than other Americans. A study found that the racial and ethnic isolation of Whites at the zip-code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support, and this correlation persisted while controlling for dozens of other variables. Support for Trump increased with voters' physical distance from the Mexican border.\n\n5. Relative deprivation: This refers to the experience of feeling deprived of something one believes they are entitled to. Trump supporters who feel that American jobs are being lost to Mexico and China may be experiencing relative deprivation, particularly in swing states like Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This kind of deprivation is based on a skewed perception of entitlement, rather than an absolute lack of resources.\n\nThese psychological phenomena help explain the peculiar behavior of Trump's supporters, but further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.",

This adds some credibility.\n   \n2. **Source**: The claim is attributed to an interview with Liam Payne in Rollacoaster magazine, which would need verification to confirm its authenticity.\n\n3. **Plausibility**: While the incident could feasibly happen, it also could be a fabricated or exaggerated story for publicity or other reasons.\n\n4. **Contextual Clarity**: The message lacks direct evidence or corroboration beyond Payne's statement, making it reliant on the trustworthiness of the source.\n\nGiven these points, without further corroborative evidence, the veracity of the message remains uncertain.

The lawsuit was filed by Mueller, who claimed that the singer got him fired from his job at 98.5 KYGO after Mueller groped her at a concert in 2013. The judge ruled that Swift could not be held liable for Mueller's firing because he failed to prove that she personally set out to have him fired. Mueller's similar allegations against Swift's mother, Andrea Swift, and her radio liaison, Frank Bell, will go to a jury for a verdict, with closing statements set for Monday. Swift's case against Mueller for assault and battery is still going forward. Swift, who is countersuing Mueller for $1, took the stand on Thursday to detail the incident. Mueller's attorney noted that Swift could have taken a break following the alleged incident. Swift's former bodyguard, Greg Dent, also took the stand on Friday and testified that he saw Mueller's hand under Swift's skirt. Swift's countersuit against the DJ will also go before a jury next week with closing arguments set to begin on Monday morning.",

The 38-year-old was taken to the emergency room by her beau Geno and daughter Alana after she woke up without vision in both eyes.\n\nAfter examining her, a doctor revealed that Mama June was suffering from a detached retina and needed immediate surgery. The reality star was understandably worried about the procedure, as she feared she might lose her sight in her good eye. \"What if I lose sight in my good eye? I went totally blind in my right eye four years ago!\" she exclaimed.\n\nDespite her fears, Mama June underwent the surgery and it was a success. She was able to return home to recover, but there was still a 50/50 chance that she would regain sight. The family, including pregnant daughter Pumpkin, were overjoyed to have her back home, and Pumpkin even moved back into the house to help her mother in her recovery.\n\nHowever, there was also trouble in paradise. Mama June's ex-husband Sugar Bear was extremely upset because he believed that she was trying to keep their daughter Alana away from him. He left an angry message on the phone, screaming, \"You're a damn b*tch, June. Last time you're gonna mess with me.\" He even decided to throw bricks at a picture of Mama June.\n\nIn other drama, Sugar Bear's girlfriend Jennifer received a paternity test in the mail, as she didn't believe that he was Alana's birth father.

Pitt will have custody of the children from June 8 to June 17, for four hours per day, while he stays in London, where Jolie is renting a house.

Celebrities are often scrutinized for such behaviors even when they are not indicative of pregnancy.\n\n3. **Quoted Statements**: The quote attributed to Nicole Kidman about her hope for another baby adds some credibility, but without a direct confirmation from her or her representatives, it remains speculative.\n\n4. **Commonsense Evaluation**: It's not uncommon for celebrity gossip to speculate about pregnancies based on minor behaviors or quotes taken out of context. However, celebrities also have personal lives that may not always align with public speculation.\n\nConsidering these points, while the message presents circumstantial evidence and quotes, the source (New Idea) and the nature of the claims suggest it leans towards gossip rather than verified news. Therefore, I assess the veracity of this message as **0** (unlikely to be real).",

The singer, accompanied by her daughter Blue Ivy and husband Jay-Z, was seen in a long, stomach-covering gown with a low-cut neckline and a revealing cleavage. While some fans speculate that the dress may have been strategically designed to hide a baby bump, others point out that Beyonce has performed while pregnant before, so it's possible that she is not actually with child.\n\nThe rumors began after Beyonce appeared to give a subtle hint that she was pregnant during a concert stop on her On The Run II tour in Rome on July 8. In fan footage from the concert, she can be seen briefly rubbing her stomach. This gesture led some fans to speculate that she was pregnant, and she confirmed the news at the 2011 VMAs, where she revealed that she was pregnant with daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nBeyonce and Jay-Z have a history of naming their albums after the number four, with Beyonce releasing 4 in 2011 and Jay-Z releasing 4:44 in 2017. It's possible that they may choose to name their fourth child after this number, adding to the rumors that a fourth child is on the way for the Carters.\n\nWhile Beyonce's appearance may be causing some to speculate about a possible baby bump, it's important to remember that appearances can be deceiving and that only time will tell if she is actually pregnant.",

This contrasts with the narrative of a family-wide ban due to Kris Jenner's behavior.\n\n4. **Plausibility Check**: Events like the \"Night Before\" party are exclusive and invite-only, with attendees chosen carefully. While controversies can influence invitations, a blanket ban on an entire family based on one member's behavior seems extreme and unusual without further concrete evidence.\n\nConsidering these points, the claim lacks strong verifiable evidence beyond anonymous sources and sensational reporting.

If there has been no recent album release or news thereof, it casts doubt on the authenticity of the entire message.\n\n2. **Lyric analysis and speculation**: While it's common for fans to analyze lyrics, specific references to a song named \"Finesse\" and speculation about the subject matter (Bella Hadid, Fashion Week, \"your sister\") can be verified by checking reputable music news sources or Drake's official statements.\n\n3. **Drake's rumored relationship with Bella Hadid**: Claims about a relationship between Drake and Bella Hadid, as well as the involvement of Bella's sister Gigi Hadid, should be corroborated with reliable celebrity news sources or statements from involved parties.\n\n4. **Contradictory statements**: Mention of Drake's mother, Yolanda, supposedly downplaying rumors suggests there may be conflicting reports or statements that need verification.\n\n5. **Consistency with known facts**: If the details align with established facts about Drake's life and career, it lends credibility to the message. Any inconsistencies or implausible claims would raise doubts.\n\nGiven these points, a thorough check against official sources like Drake's social media, official press releases, or reputable entertainment news outlets would be necessary to determine the veracity of this message.

Hollywood's least serious award show is set to kick off the awards season, and while it may not hold the same weight as the Oscars, it often foreshadows the direction that the industry is heading in. Hosting the show this year is none other than Seth Meyers, who you may recognize from his NBC late-night show, \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\"\n\nThis will be Meyers' first time hosting the Golden Globes, but he's not exactly a stranger to talk show hosting. He'll be following in the footsteps of Jimmy Fallon, who hosted last year. NBC is marketing the show under the tagline \"Hollywood, we have a lot to talk about,\" so expect lots of humor and not-at-all uncomfortable and awkward moments about the recent turmoil in Hollywood over sexual harassment and abuse.\n\nMeyers spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about taking on the gig, revealing that he discussed it with his wife and women on his writing staff. He saw it as an opportunity to \"say some things that you wouldn't be able to say in previous years.\"\n\nOn the film side of things, The Shape of Water leads with seven nominations, followed closely by The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, both with six nods. Lady Bird is also up for several big awards, although not for Best Director, which once again overlooked all female directors.\n\nThe TV awards are more widely distributed, with HBO's Big Little Lies leading with six nominations, but it's up against a slate of other prominent prestige shows, including The Handmaid's Tale, This Is Us, Master of None, Stranger Things, and The Crown.\n\nThe ceremony will begin at 5PM PT / 8PM ET on Sunday, January 7th, and will take place at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The show will be broadcast live on NBC, as it has been since 1993. If you're in need of some extra glamour, you can tune in an hour earlier for the red carpet arrivals, which will be streamed exclusively on Facebook.\n\nSo how do you watch? If you have NBC, you can watch through an over-the-air antenna, cable, or satellite. If not, fear not! This year, NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have reached a deal to allow for online streaming of the awards show. Simply head to NBC's app or website, or check your cable or satellite provider for online access. And if you're not a subscriber, most of these services offer free seven-day trials, so you can give it a shot without committing to a long-term subscription.\n\nTwitter will also be a great resource for following along with reactions and memes in real time, and The Verge will be reporting live on the night, with a running list of winners, reactions, and other news. So gather around the TV, gather round the internet, and let's celebrate Hollywood's finest.",

When she and Topper divorced, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City.

Kelly has released a new 19-minute song, \"I Admit,\" addressing the sexual abuse claims against him and revealing the personal troubles that have plagued him throughout his career.\n\nThe track, which was posted to Soundcloud on Monday, begins with the lyrics, \"I admit I have made some mistakes/And I have some imperfect ways.\" Kelly then gets personal, singing that he likes \"all the ladies, that's both older and young ladies,\" followed by the statement, \"But tell me how they call it pedophile because that (expletive) is crazy.\"\n\nThe embattled entertainer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has long been accused of behavior that has ranged from questionable to criminal. He was accused of child pornography after a widely circulated videotape appeared to show him having sex with, and urinating on, a teenage girl. He was acquitted of all charges in 2008 and continued to rack up hits and sell out stadiums around the country.\n\nOn \"I Admit,\" Kelly sings that he's \"not convicted, not arrested, dragged my name in the dirt/All this work to be successful, when you abandon me 'cause of what you heard.\" The song also reveals that he was sexually abused as a child, with the lyrics, \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nKelly is one of pop music's best-selling artists and his hits include \"Ignition,\" ''I Believe I Can Fly,\" ''Step in the Name of Love\" and \"Bump N' Grind.\" He has also written hits for artists ranging from Celine Dion to Michael Jackson to Lady Gaga. While he's written classic love songs and even gospel music, he is defined by sexually explicit songs such as \"Feelin' on Yo Booty,\" ''Your Body's Calling Me,\" ''Sex Me\" and even more explicit fare.\n\nOn the new song, he says he was sexually abused as a child, singing \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nThe song has sparked outrage on social media, with celebrities and activists condemning Kelly and calling for his arrest. Rapper Talib Kweli Greene said in a Twitter post, \"His lack of self-awareness is atrocious. There are several lyrics I take offense to. The one I will address is 'I‚Äôm just a man.' I am also a man. I would never use that to defend this behavior.\"\n\nIn conjunction to the #MeToo movement, Viola Davis, Shonda Rhimes and Ava DuVernay and other celebrities participated in the Time's Up movement's #MuteRKelly social media campaign in April, calling for a boycott of his music and performances.\n\nKelly's concert in his hometown of Chicago was canceled around the time the Times' Up campaign took aim at the singer over allegations he sexually abused women. Weeks later, Spotify removed his music from its playlists, citing its new policy on hate content and hateful conduct.\n\nThe song was not released on Sony's RCA Records, where Kelly is signed. The label said it had no comment about the song. Kelly posted a link to the song Monday with the caption: \"Today is the day you've been waiting for.\"\n\nIn May, a woman filed a lawsuit against Kelly, accusing the singer of sexual battery, knowingly infecting her with herpes and locking her in rooms for punishment.\n\nKelly's new track is a bold move, but it's unclear if it will be enough to save his career, which has been put on hold due to the sexual abuse claims. The #MeToo movement has exposed the dark side of the entertainment industry and Kelly's admission may not be enough to repair the damage to his reputation.\n\nKelly's fans will have to decide if they can forgive him for his past mistakes and support him moving forward.

In a recent video post on Ohanian's YouTube channel, Williams revealed that they had \"a lot of complications\" during the pregnancy, but that the baby is now healthy and strong.\n\nThe happy parents have already started sharing adorable photos and videos of their little girl on social media, with Ohanian captioning a recent post, \"Welcome, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., we're so happy to meet you. Our little girl is already mama's perfect sidekick.\"\n\nThis is the first child for Williams and Ohanian, who got engaged in December after announcing they were expecting in April. Williams has been enjoying her time off from tennis, saying that it's been a welcome change of pace. \"I've never had this time off before, or if I have I've been injured and it's really different to be injured as opposed to be expecting,\" she told ABC News. \"I've been really enjoying my time off and getting ready for this new massive chapter in my life.\"\n\nABC News' Katie Kindelan contributed to this report.",

Given the sensational nature of the claims (sexual harassment, profanity-laced meetings), it would likely have attracted broader media attention if true.\n\n4. **Language and Style**: The language used is somewhat formal but lacks journalistic neutrality. Genuine news reports usually maintain a more objective tone, whereas this message includes subjective statements about legal outcomes and jury beliefs.\n\nConsidering these points, the message appears more like a fictional scenario or a speculative piece rather than a real news report.

But what they uncovered was nothing short of shocking!\n\nThe family's first session was conducted by two communications coaches from Clarity media training, and things quickly got intense. The coaches grilled the family with some of the most uncomfortable and personal questions about their family, including Kim's sex tape and Kris Jenner's strained relationship with Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nAfter opening their line of questioning by bringing up Kim's sex tape, the coaches went on to cover everything from Kendall's Pepsi commercial to Rob's explosive behavior. Kris was especially emotional as she revealed that her daughters had kept a lot of her secrets from her over the years.\n\n‚ÄúThere were things that happened that they didn‚Äôt tell me, because they were told not to,‚Äù said Kris. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not resentful about it, it just makes me really sad. Because I‚Äôm a protective mom ‚Äî I would do anything for my kids. And had I known some of the things they were experiencing‚Ä¶ it just broke my heart, hearing some of that stuff.‚Äù\n\nThe media training session was so intense that Kourtney even flailed and laughed nervously at one point, but ultimately all of the women walked away with newfound confidence and knowledge. Kris even put her newfound skills to the test in an interview conducted by basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nBut the drama didn't end there. Kendall and Kylie were also going through some issues of their own, with the two fighting over their ‚Äútwo completely different ideas‚Äù for a birthday party.\n\nIn the end, the family managed to work it out off-camera, but tensions were still high.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians returns Jan. 7 at 9 p.m. ET on E!

Get the Scoop on His Lavish Lifestyle and Divorce Settlement with Kelly Clarkson!\"\n\nIf you've been following the latest celeb gossip, then you've probably heard of Brandon Blackstock. This American talent manager has a net worth of a staggering $10 million, making him one of the richest people in the business. But how did he get so rich? And what's his life like? In this exclusive article, we'll reveal all the details on Brandon's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about Brandon's net worth. As a talent manager, he's worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Kelly Clarkson. And it seems that his hard work has paid off big time. In 2023, Brandon was awarded a whopping $10 million net worth, making him one of the wealthiest people in the business.\n\nBut how did he get so rich? Well, Brandon has been in the music industry for over a decade, starting out as a talent agent for his stepmother, Reba McEntire. He later formed his own talent management company, Starstruck Entertainment, which manages the careers of many successful musicians and actors.\n\nBut Brandon's success didn't stop there. In 2013, he married Kelly Clarkson, the stunning singer and winner of American Idol. Together, they have two children and a luxurious lifestyle. In 2018, they lived in an $8 million mansion in Encino, California, before Kelly bought a $10 million mansion in the same neighborhood.\n\nBut things didn't go as smoothly as planned in their marriage. In 2020, Kelly filed for divorce from Brandon, citing irreconcilable differences. But before things could get too far, Brandon filed for spousal and child support, asking for $436,000 per month. A judge eventually ordered Kelly to pay him $45,000 per month in child support and $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years. She also had to pay him $1.2 million to cover his legal expenses.\n\nBut things got even more complicated when Kelly claimed that Brandon had defrauded her during his 13 years as her manager. She accused him of overcharging her millions of dollars and not being licensed to operate as a talent agent. Brandon's company, Starstruck Management Group, countered by pointing out that Kelly was always properly represented by her separate talent agency, CAA.\n\nIn the end, an LA judge sided with Kelly, ruling that Brandon had indeed overcharged her.

In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight's Lauren Zima, Adams admitted that he owes his romance to none other than Bachelor host Chris Harrison.\n\n\"Chris Harrison even takes a bit of credit for my girlfriend,\" laughed the Bachelor Nation favorite. \"If I hadn't done the show and met Chris and all those people, I would have never had the opportunity to meet this amazing woman. So, I won the show!\"\n\nThe couple, who have been living together in Los Angeles for a month, have been inseparable since they connected over Instagram last year. Hyland, a self-proclaimed Bachelor Nation superfan, saw Adams on the show and was immediately smitten.\n\n\"It was the night before the Emmys party, and it was the day I knew I was going to move to L.A.,\" revealed Adams. \"It was the start of a new chapter in my life, and I was ready to take it on.\"\n\nBut for Adams, finding Hyland wasn't just about luck. It was about being emotionally ready for a relationship. \"For me, you need to be ready [for the relationship.] If you watch The Bachelor, some people are like, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm really ready,‚Äô and you‚Äôre not -- you‚Äôre 24 years old. And I think there came a point in my life where I was like, I really do want this. I don‚Äôt want to be single anymore. This isn‚Äôt fun for me,\" he confessed.\n\nAnd Hyland was the perfect match for him. \"We're both huge dorks, we have similar interests. Our brands are the same! Dogs, rose, tacos, [and] The Bachelor!\"\n\nAs the couple approaches their one-year anniversary of when they first met, Adams is grateful for the path his Bachelor journey took him on. \"It's been weirdly perfect, there have been no real issues. We were scared about the dogs meeting, but that went really well. It‚Äôs been perfect. It‚Äôs been great,\" he shared.\n\nSo, it seems like Bachelor Nation's favorite couple is here to stay. And with their adorable dog, it's clear that they're ready to take on the world together.",

After months of speculation, Jenner released a 10-minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her child. The announcement comes after months of speculation and a Calvin Klein campaign by all the Kardashian sisters that convinced fans that Jenner was expecting a child.\n\nFollowing the announcement that Khloe Kardashian is pregnant with her first baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, fans have been calling on Jenner to confirm the news. Some fans were frustrated that she didn't confirm it in a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, when Kardashian told her she was pregnant. Jenner and her boyfriend Travis Scott have been spotted looking loved up and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, indicating that they are still together.\n\nFans have been speculating about Jenner's pregnancy for months, with some pointing to an old social media video from the Golden Globes where they claim to see a baby bump. Photos taken \"months ago\" from her friend's birthday party also show Jenner in an oversized jumper, concealing her figure. The absence of Jenner from social media led to rumors that she had split from Scott, but a recent video put these rumors to rest.\n\nAfter 24 days of snippets from the famous Kardashian Christmas card, fans were convinced day 25, Christmas Day, would be the big reveal. However, Jenner was nowhere to be seen at all, leaving fans sure that she was heavily pregnant. Fans were still convinced a baby announcement was on the way after spotting a \"clue\" in one of the Kardashian Christmas calendar photos.\n\nDuring the upcoming Christmas special of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris Jenner revealed what she was most thankful for ‚Äì and got very emotional. \"I used to pray that one of you guys would have a baby and now it‚Äôs like a faucet that we turned on that won‚Äôt turn off,\" she confessed. \"The fact that I have all these grandchildren...\" Fans couldn't help but make the connection following Jenner's pregnancy reports.\n\nIn pictures obtained by The Sun, a marquee lined with pink curtains can be seen set up at the back of Jenner's LA mansion, showing pink decorations filling the garden. Pink objects appear to be floating in the pool, while matching cushions adorn the seating area. Jenner appeared in pink silk pyjamas, suggesting the baby shower was for herself and she is expecting a baby girl.\n\nFans are convinced they know when Scott found out the \"happy news\" from Jenner, who has a huge net worth. On June 12, the star cryptically tweeted: \"Legit the happiest day of my life.\" According to Perez Hilton, this would coincide perfectly with the reported due date, and the pair went on to get a matching butterfly tattoo.\n\nPeople magazine originally reported that Jenner was due to give birth in February 2018. A source said: \"They started telling friends a few weeks ago. The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis!\" Another insider added: \"It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about. Everyone is overjoyed for her. This is the happiest she‚Äôs ever been.\"\n\nJenner has not confirmed or denied her pregnancy, but reports have already begun speculating about what she would name her future child. An alleged insider told Hollywood Life: \"She would like to do something both unique and keep the 'K' first name consistent with her sisters and mum.\" Fans thought she may have gone with the name Butterfly given that she and Scott both have matching small butterfly tattoos on their ankles. Jenner told Elle UK in December 2015 that she would delete her account as soon as she has a child. \"Once I have a kid, I‚Äôm not going to be on Instagram,\" she said. ‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôll probably delete my Instagram and just...

Here's why:\n\n1. **Content Analysis**: The message discusses a complex and private situation involving specific individuals (Tristan Thompson and the Kardashian-Jenner family) with detailed negotiations and conditions (staying temporarily, refraining from spreading stories, financial demands). Such detailed and specific claims about private negotiations are often speculative when reported outside official channels.\n\n2. **Lack of Attribution**: The message does not cite any official or credible sources for these claims. Information about celebrities and their personal lives often originates from tabloid or unverified sources, which reduces the reliability of such reports.\n\n3. **Unlikely Nature of Claims**: The conditions mentioned (demanding profits and restrictions on spreading stories) are highly personal and legally sensitive. It's uncommon for such negotiations to be openly discussed without consent, adding to the skepticism.\n\n4. **Familiar Context**: The subject matter involving celebrities and private negotiations is a common target for fabricated or exaggerated stories due to public interest and media attention.\n\nConsidering these points, the message is likely not a real and credible representation of the actual situation.

However, the specific details of Robert Pattinson watching and approving Stewart's performance would need to be verified through more reliable sources or direct statements.\n\n4. **Likelihood of Public Reaction**: Given the nature of SNL and its audience, it is likely that jokes about a famous publicized relationship and a tweet from a former president would receive reactions from the audience, including laughter.\n\nConsidering these points, while some details would benefit from additional verification, the overall description aligns with what could reasonably happen on a live show like SNL.

Selena is credited as the songwriter of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,\" and she did interviews where she discussed her songs, including their meanings.\n\n2. **Claim 2: The song was inspired by Chris P√©rez joining Los Dinos.**\n   - Veracity: Likely true. Selena and Chris P√©rez's personal and professional relationship was well-known, and it's plausible that significant events in their lives influenced her music.\n\n3. **Claim 3: The song became more popular after Selena's death and was covered by Jennifer Lopez and Kat Von D.**\n   - Veracity: True. Selena's tragic death in 1995 led to increased popularity of her music, including \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,\" which has indeed been covered by various artists, including Jennifer Lopez.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears to be describing known and verifiable facts about Selena, her songwriting process, and the cultural impact of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.\" Therefore, the veracity assessment leans towards it being a real message.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nVeracity assessment: 1",

This claim could potentially be verified through historical records, interviews, or documented sources from that time period. Selena was indeed known for her songwriting abilities, so it is plausible that she could have written the song.\n\nSecondly, the message mentions that Selena described \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" as the sound of the heart when it sees a man pass by, and she wrote it after Chris P√©rez joined Los Dinos. This detail aligns with known facts about Selena's personal and professional life, including her relationship with Chris P√©rez, which lends credibility to this part of the story.\n\nThirdly, it states that \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" gained increased popularity after Selena's death and has been covered by Jennifer Lopez and Kat Von D.

These are plausible scenarios in personal relationships, although the specifics of Justin Bieber's tattoos would require fact-checking for accuracy.\n\n2. **Language and Context**: The message is coherent and uses culturally relevant examples (Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez) to illustrate its points.

With the midterm elections just around the corner, the speech has become a vital opportunity for the president to sway voters and address the issues that are on the minds of Americans.\n\nThe speech is expected to focus on immigration, border security, infrastructure, tax changes, and strong economic growth in the U.S., as well as the benefits of the recently enacted tax changes and an America-first trade policy. The president will also highlight a national security policy of ‚Äúpeace through strength,‚Äù and use the opportunity to reveal the details of his long-awaited infrastructure plan.\n\nWhile the president has demonstrated considerable unpredictability in his first year in office, straying from scripted speeches and creating headaches for his staff, it remains to be seen whether he will deviate from the script on Tuesday. With the overall advantage for Democratic candidates over Republicans in the polls, lawmakers have a narrow window for swaying voters, and could face praise or backlash from their constituents, possibly affecting election results this fall.\n\nThe guest list for the State of the Union has been revealed, with the president and first lady inviting 15 special guests, ranging from workers and business owners who have benefited from the economy, to parents of gang-violence victims, to military members and public servants, to volunteers. However, several House Democrats have announced they will not attend, including Reps.

Despite never working with Weinstein, Hanks expressed his disgust and shock at the allegations.\n\nWhen asked why Hollywood ‚Äúsheltered‚Äù Weinstein despite rumors of his inappropriate behavior, Hanks rejected the excuse that his behavior could be considered old-fashioned. He asked, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs a really good question and isn‚Äôt it part and parcel to all of society somehow, that people in power get away with this?‚Äù\n\nHanks emphasized that power in Hollywood can be rather manipulative. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can,‚Äù the actor said.\n\n‚ÄúThey think their achievements entitle them,‚Äù Hanks said, proceeding to reference a quote about power. ‚ÄúSomebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: ‚ÄòWhen you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are,'‚Äù Hanks said.\n\nHanks agrees with the quote, saying he supports the negative backlash against the movie mogul. ‚ÄúI would say, there‚Äôs an example of how that‚Äôs true. Just because you‚Äôre rich and famous and powerful doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away ‚Äòfat,'‚Äù Hanks said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not, you know, I‚Äôm not the first person to say Harvey‚Äôs a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey ‚Äî I‚Äôm not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn‚Äôt it kind of amazing that it took this long? I‚Äôm reading it and I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don‚Äôt do that. That ain‚Äôt fair. Not her, come on. Come on!‚Äù\n\nHanks also commented on the sexism that continues to exist within Hollywood, referring to the show Mad Men, to which he says ‚Äúhad absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period.‚Äù He explained, ‚ÄúThose people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, ‚ÄòHey, wait, that‚Äôs going on today? Shouldn‚Äôt we be on this?‚Äô Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it‚Äôs happening?

It mentions that both actors initially had reservations about the unconventional production style but were convinced by the director to participate. Debra Messing supposedly explained her decision to accept the role in an interview with EurWeb, emphasizing her instinct-driven approach to choosing roles. The message concludes by stating that the film is currently in theaters.\n\nTo assess the veracity of this message, we can consider several factors:\n\n1. **Film Existence and Premise**: It's plausible that a film titled \"Searching\" exists, as such films have been produced before (e.g., the 2018 thriller \"Searching\" starring John Cho). The description of the film's unique production style aligns with what was innovative about the actual film.\n\n2. **Involvement of Debra Messing and John Cho**: While John Cho did star in the actual film \"Searching,\" there is no confirmation in the provided text about Debra Messing's involvement. This raises a potential discrepancy.\n\n3. **Statement by Debra Messing**: Without further verification from the EurWeb interview or other reliable sources, the claim about Debra Messing's rationale for accepting the role remains unverified.\n\n4. **Current Status of the Film**: The assertion that the film is now playing in theaters would need verification from current sources to confirm its accuracy at the time of assessment.\n\nConsidering these points, the message contains a mix of verifiable details (such as the film's premise and production style) and potentially unverified claims (specifically regarding Debra Messing's involvement and statements).

Bieber and Baldwin had a whirlwind romance that led to Bieber popping the question on July 7. They had only started dating a month before that, rekindling a romance that Bieber ended in 2016 because he didn't want to be tied down to one woman.

With over 435 episodes, Grey's Anatomy has surpassed even The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, which ran for 15 seasons and 435 episodes. Only seven dramas in the history of television have had more seasons than Grey's, including Gunsmoke, Law & Order, NCIS, CSI, and ER.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made official at the wrap party for the Shonda Rhimes drama, where ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey praised the show's loyal fans and the new generations of viewers who continue to discover the joy and drama of Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made possible thanks to a new two-year deal signed by star Ellen Pompeo, who remains the highest-earning actress on a drama series. The deal includes a seven-figure signing bonus, two full backend equity points on the show, and producing fees on both the flagship series and spinoff Station 19.\n\nGrey's Anatomy has become increasingly important for ABC since creator Shonda Rhimes left her longtime home at ABC Studios for a nine-figure deal with Netflix. Rhimes has since handed off day-to-day control of the show to Krista Vernoff, who has helped creatively recharge the series and Pompeo.\n\nThe current 14th season ranks as ABC's No. 1 drama among the advertiser-coveted adults 18-49 demographic and No. 2 at the network among total viewers. With Pompeo, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson, and James Pickens Jr. all set to return for season 15, along with co-stars Kevin McKidd, Jesse Williams, Caterina Scorsone, Camilla Luddington, Kelly McCreary, Giacomo Gianniotti, Sarah Drew, and Jessica Capshaw, Grey's Anatomy is set to continue its reign as the longest-running primetime drama in history.\n\nGrey's Anatomy joins a roster of ABC shows set to return for 2018-19, including comedies The Goldbergs, Modern Family, and Roseanne, as well as the previously renewed Good Doctor.

Firstly, disputes and tensions on sets of popular TV shows are not uncommon, especially when high-profile actors like Witherspoon and Streep are involved. Such conflicts can arise due to various reasons such as creative differences, competitive dynamics, or personal interactions. Witherspoon's dual role as an actor and executive producer could feasibly contribute to power struggles and perceptions of dominance.

In the absence of such evidence, these claims lean towards being speculative rather than factual.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears to describe a situation where conspiracy theories are being discussed rather than presenting verified facts.

        "content": "\"The Hills\" Cast Unveils Secrets and Scandals!\n\nThe cast of \"The Hills\" has finally opened up about their biggest secrets, including the infamous sex tape that rocked the reality TV world. According to producers, the challenge was getting access to the real story behind the drama.\n\nLauren Conrad was the one who refused to mention Heidi Montag's name, and producers had to work with her to access what they knew was the real story. Meanwhile, Heidi was still trying to make up with Lauren and wanted to be a part of the show.\n\nBut the biggest scandal of all was the sex tape rumors that Lauren didn't want to talk about. Despite this being a huge betrayal, producers knew they had to work with Lauren to get to the bottom of it.\n\nThe producers were lucky enough to be at the nightclub where Heidi and Spencer Pratt might show up. They knew Lauren was there, and they were hoping to catch up with them.\n\nThe nightclub scene was explosive, and the producers had to rush to get their cameras there. They even had to avoid filming, but the fight between Lauren and Heidi happened so quickly that they had no choice but to film it.\n\nJustin Bobby Brescia, the anti-Spencer Pratt, was a surprise each week, as he was always putting on a show for the cameras. But off-camera, he was a genuinely nice person to everyone on the crew.\n\nIn Audrina and Justin's case, he was the bad guy who was really charming, and she was always trying to break up with him. Every time she would want to do it, they would have to have a conversation on camera so that audiences could see the process.\n\nLauren Conrad's mascara tears during her fight with Audrina in season 4 have become the GIF that keeps on GIF-fing from \"The Hills.\" But the producers actually received letters asking why she didn't wear waterproof mascara.\n\nThe mascara thing just happened, and it became a thing. Most of the time, when they were shooting, they would be sitting on their balcony, and the black eyeliner roll was their only device to tell stories.\n\nWe got so many letters that were like, \"Why didn't she wear waterproof mascara?\", and I never could answer that. I didn't know.\n\nIn conclusion, the cast of \"The Hills\" has finally revealed their biggest secrets and Scandals, including the infamous sex tape and Lauren's mascara tears. Will these revelations change the way we see the show? Stay tuned to find out!",

The actress, who is currently showcasing her solo exhibition of oil paintings at downtown gallery Sargent's Daughters, admitted that she doesn't particularly enjoy weddings and that her own wedding was \"pointless.\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered when asked if she had fun at hers. \"I mean, it was fine, it was quick, it was simple, but it was pointless. Either you're throwing a party, or you're doing it out of necessity.\"\n\nDespite her strong opinions on marriage, Kirke left the door open for the possibility of getting married again, but only if she is not holding out any false hopes. \"It wouldn‚Äôt be under any delusions of thinking it would mean that it would improve anything or change things for the better,\" she said.",

The director, Taika Waititi, shows promise, but I believe the writers could have done better in their attempts to alter the series' tone and create a coherent narrative. The fanbase was overly hyped about the film, and while it was amusing, it wasn't as funny as Guardians of the Galaxy. The characters' behavior deviated from their established personalities, and the pacing felt rushed. The Sakaar sequences detracted from the movie's backstory on Asgard, and I wish more had been shown of Hela. Odin's scene was also somewhat absurd.\n\nValkyrie is fine, but I don't like the portrayal as a drunk. It's a cliche, and it doesn't accurately reflect the character. I love her chemistry with Bruce, and I hope their relationship continues in future installments. There doesn't seem to be any romantic tension between Valkyrie and Thor, which is fine.\n\nLoki was the butt of jokes and seemed to lack his usual depth. He wasn't entirely in line with his previous characterization, and I question his relevance to the story. If Marvel doesn't give him a clear purpose beyond satisfying fans, his contract may not be renewed. I wouldn't be surprised if he's 'killed' off in Infinity War and then brought back to life in Avengers 4, perhaps as Kid Loki or Agent of Asgard Loki as Marvel introduces new Avengers members and seeks to reboot the franchise.\n\nI enjoyed the dynamic between Bruce and Thor, and I don't like the forced inclusion of the Black Widow scene. I would prefer to see more scenes featuring Valkyrie and Bruce. The events of the movie left me feeling like I was watching a fan fiction or side story.

Ripa spoke out about Strahan's exit in People, saying that she can understand why he might have made an \"oversight\" not to inform her of his departure.

Instead of the traditional \"Will you marry me?\" he said, \"I got you something.\" And when Jwan Yosef questioned what the question was, Martin revealed, \"Would you marry me?\"\n\nThe answer was yes, and the two made their red carpet debut in April at the amFAR Inspiration Gala in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Martin has been spotted wearing an engagement ring since then, and now the news has finally been confirmed.\n\nMartin, who has two young sons with his ex-partner Carlos Gonzalez Abella, is said to be \"thrilled\" with his new addition to the family. Jwan Yosef is a conceptual artist, and Martin collects art, so it seems they have a lot in common.\n\nThe couple have been together for over a year, and fans are thrilled with the news of their engagement. Congratulations, Ricky and Jwan!",

According to Sheen, their passion for politics was what ultimately led to their separation.\n\nSheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the '30s, told the Daily Telegraph that the Brexit referendum was what inspired him to become more politically active. However, their desire to make a difference in the world led them to take different paths. Silverman, an American, wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, while Sheen, a Welshman, wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.\n\n\"We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions‚Äîbecause she is American and I‚Äôm Welsh,\" Sheen explained. \"After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved.

I hope you have the best day!\" Cruz, 13, gave his dad a card with a giant gorilla on it, the words \"Dad, you the man\" spelled out in bold letters. Harper Seven, 6, gave her dad a key chain with the words \"Daddy's wine cellar. Love Harper! XOXO\" etched on it.\n\nAs the day wore on, Brooklyn posted a photo of his dad enjoying a glass of red wine, looking relaxed and happy.

News. \"You have to divide your energy between raising a kid and carrying one as well.\"\n\nBut Teigen isn't the only one who believes that second pregnancies can be harder. Many moms of multiple young kids share this sentiment, feeling more tired and drained than they did with their first pregnancy. Add in the responsibility of taking care of another child and the physical and hormonal changes that come with pregnancy, and it's no wonder why some women feel like their second pregnancy is a whole new ball game.\n\nDespite the challenges, Teigen is already thinking ahead to what life will be like with two young children at home. She recently joked that her son will be getting all of his clothes from his sister Luna's hand-me-downs. And while pregnancy can be exhausting, Teigen is doing her best to keep her fans at bay when it comes to her personal decisions and due date.\n\nBut when her pregnancy is over, Teigen will have to deal with even more challenges. She's worried that her 2-year-old daughter Luna won't be the best at sharing her toys and attention with her new baby boy. But with plenty of time until her due date in June, Teigen is taking things one day at a time and enjoying every moment of her pregnancy.\n\nStay tuned for more on Teigen's pregnancy journey and all things parenting on Romper's new video series, Bearing The Motherload.

According to April Masini, a relationship expert and online advice forum host, the couple's pattern of breaking up and getting back together is a bad behavioral pattern that can become a source of strain in their daily lives. \"Drama replaces problem solving and breakups become a very disruptive part of the relationship dynamic,\" Masini said.\n\nSusan Winter, another relationship expert and best-selling author, added that reuniting with an ex is typically not worthwhile unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted. \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" Winter said. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.\"\n\nRachel DeAlto, another relationship expert, agreed that getting back together with an ex is often more trouble than it's worth. \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" DeAlto said. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.\"\n\nDespite these experts' advice, it's possible that Evans and Slate may be following the same line of thinking that has led to their previous breakups. \"They're a great odd couple, and Hollywood loves an odd couple romance,\" Masini said. \"And they're not insusceptible to what fans love to see, which makes their issues even tougher.\"\n\nThe good news is that breakups can often lead to positive change. \"A breakup can be an enormous motivator to improve ourselves,\" Winter said. \"The clients that come to me and tell me they've lost somebody they love are so incredibly motivated to correct and change things about themselves and their personality.\"\n\nWhether Evans and Slate will heed this advice remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: getting back together with an ex is rarely the solution to relationship problems.",

        "td_rationale": "Based on the provided message, the likelihood of its veracity seems more like a promotional or persuasive piece rather than a factual statement. Here's the reasoning:\n\nThe message describes a significant shift in bridal fashion, claiming that traditional white wedding gowns are outdated and replaced by bold, unconventional colors like black, pink, and yellow. It encourages readers to embrace this change and emphasizes the beauty and uniqueness of these new styles.\n\nSeveral elements suggest that this message is more promotional than factual:\n1. **Language and Tone**: The message uses persuasive language (\"Say goodbye,\" \"embrace the beauty,\" \"break free\") typical of marketing or promotional materials rather than neutral, factual reporting.\n   \n2. **Absence of Objective Evidence**: There are no specific data points, statistics, or expert opinions cited to support the claim that white wedding gowns are \"a thing of the past\" or that colorful dresses are now dominant.\n\n3. **Subjectivity**: The message appeals to emotions and personal preferences (\"embrace the endless possibilities of color and style\"), which are subjective rather than objective criteria.\n\n4. **Generalization**: The statement presents a sweeping generalization about a cultural shift in bridal fashion without acknowledging potential regional, cultural, or demographic variations.\n\nConsidering these points, the message appears to be advocating for a particular perspective rather than objectively reporting a verifiable change in bridal fashion trends. Therefore, it is more likely a promotional message rather than a factual statement. Hence, the prediction would be:\n\n**Result: 0**",
        "cs_rationale": "The message advocates for a shift in bridal fashion, suggesting a departure from traditional white wedding gowns to more unconventional colors like black, pink, and yellow. It promotes embracing diversity and individuality in bridal attire, encouraging brides to break away from the norms of the past. \n\nTo assess its veracity, we can consider several points:\n1. **Cultural Shift**: There has indeed been a noticeable trend towards more diverse and non-traditional wedding attire in recent years. Many brides are opting for colors beyond white to express personal style and uniqueness.\n\n2. **Fashion Trends**: Fashion is known for evolving and challenging norms. Bridal fashion, like all aspects of fashion, reflects changing tastes and attitudes in society.\n\n3. **Consumer Behavior**: The message appeals to the growing consumer desire for customization and personal expression in weddings, which aligns with broader trends in consumer behavior.\n\n4. **Industry Innovation**: The bridal industry has shown adaptation to new trends and consumer demands, with designers and retailers offering more diverse options in bridal wear.\n\nConsidering these points, the message's assertion that traditional white wedding gowns are becoming less dominant and that unconventional colors are gaining popularity appears to align with current trends and cultural shifts. Therefore, it is more likely to be a real message reflecting ongoing changes in bridal fashion. \n\n**Verdict: 1**\n\nThus, I predict the veracity of the message as 1, indicating it is more likely a real message reflecting current trends in bridal fashion.",

It was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing now looking back at it. It was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people.

The dress was actually a blue and black bandage dress from British retailer Roman Originals, but people saw it as gold and white or blue and black. The debate raged on for days, with 7.6 million tweets and a surge in traffic to Roman Originals' site. The retailer sold out of the original black and gold dress in 34 minutes and eventually sold a white and gold version in support of British charity Comic Relief.\n\nApril the Giraffe's birth\n\nIn the spring of 2017, all eyes were on April, a pregnant giraffe at Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York.

The live stream garnered more than 232 million live views on YouTube over a seven-week period.\n\nThe \"yanny\" or \"laurel\" debate\n\nIn May 2018, a bizarre recording of the word \"laurel\" split the internet in two. While some heard the word \"laurel,\" others clearly heard \"yanny,\" and nobody could agree on who was right. The audio clip was from an online dictionary entry, and the differing interpretations of the clip all had to do with how the brain interprets sound frequencies.\n\nJeremy Meeks, the \"hot felon\"\n\nIn June 2014, the Stockton Police Department released a mugshot of Jeremy Meeks, a 30-year-old inmate arrested on a weapons charge. Meeks' chiseled jaw and piercing eyes quickly made him a global sensation, and he was dubbed the \"hot felon.\" Meeks signed to a modeling agency and has since worked around the world.\n\nBeyonc√©'s pregnancy announcement\n\nWhen Beyonc√© makes an announcement, the world stops to listen, and her early morning pregnancy announcement was no different.

The word became a catchphrase of sorts that spawned T-shirts, hashtags, and even a license plate. The baffling term even lent its name to a legislative proposal from U.S. Rep Mike Quigley. If enacted, the COVFEFE Act (Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act) would have required the National Archives to keep records of the president's tweets.\n\nKim Kardashian's Paper magazine cover\n\nIn 2017, Kim Kardashian's bare-all cover of Paper magazine brought the phrase \"break the internet\" into the public lexicon.

        "content": "Dwyane Wade, the star of the Miami Heat, has become one of the most highly paid basketball players in the world. With estimated net worths of over $100 million, it's hard to imagine the amount of hard work and dedication that has gone into his success.\n\nBut what exactly does Wade make his money from? The answer is simple: basketball and massive paychecks. Since joining the NBA in 2003-2004, Wade has made over $136 million playing the game he loves. His current contract pays him $15 million this season, with another $16.1 million due next season if he opts-in to his player option.\n\nBut Wade's success doesn't stop there. Along with LeBron James, Wade has mastered the art of taking short-term contracts to increase his flexibility and secure larger annual contracts. In 2014, he signed a two-year, $31.1 million contract with a player option, setting him up to be a free agent when the salary cap increases in 2016-2017. And when that time comes, Wade will be set to cash in on the biggest paydays of his career.\n\nHowever, even with all of his accomplishments, Wade was only the 21st highest-paid player in the NBA last year, according to ESPN. He made far less than players like Joe Johnson, Rudy Gay, and Brook Lopez. But that's not reason to feel bad for Wade, though. He's made tens of millions more in sponsorship deals, including a high-profile deal with a sports brand in China.\n\nOver the years, Wade has had sponsorship deals with Converse and Nike, but his biggest deal was with Chinese shoe company Li Ning. In 2012, he signed a 10-year deal with the company that few consumers know in the U.S., but which will pay him millions annually along with a reported $60 million stake in the company. It was a high-risk move for both Li Ning and Wade, and it's uncertain if it's paying off. Li Ning just reported its third straight year of losses, and its stock has gone almost nowhere since Wade signed the deal.\n\nOn top of Li Ning, Wade has had slightly less lucrative deals with Gatorade, Pepperidge Farm, Mission, and other brands. In total, Forbes estimates that he made $12 million in sponsorships last year.\n\nAdd it all up, and Dwyane Wade has made well over $200 million in his career. But after paying agents, managers, and living expenses, his net worth is likely significantly less than that. Estimates of his net worth are between $95 million and $115 million, and he has millions more coming in future years.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, Dwyane Wade has built a huge net worth and he'll likely add to it in years to come. And for those who have followed his career, it's clear that his success is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and willingness to take risks.",

He had purchased the six-story house in 2006, before marrying Chapman, and she had since transformed it with her style. The black floors and white rugs, chinoiserie, gilt, and glass, hydrangeas in a vase, and a Jo Malone candle completed the ambiance.\n\nA few weeks earlier, I had met Chapman at the Marchesa fashion company atelier, where she co-owns the business with Keren Craig. She appeared nervous and uncomfortable, mentioning that she had not been out in public for five months since similar accusations against her husband were made public. Today, she was more relaxed, though there was a sense of gallows humor. When I mentioned the warm weather, she quipped, \"Think of all the poor plants that are going to spring out and then die.\"\n\nWe moved downstairs to the ground floor, which was a large, open space with modern furniture and surprising art. There was a spacious kitchen that overlooked the backyard, and a TV room where Chapman's son Dash was sitting on a sectional encircled by some kind of electronic device. At 42, Chapman looked younger than in photographs, perhaps because she was more goofy than I had imagined. Although she retained her British accent, she was more laid-back than I had expected.\n\nOur meeting took place in Chapman's soon-to-be-ex-townhouse that had recently been sold by her soon-to-be-ex-husband. It was meant to be the first time she publicly addressed what happened with her husband. However, the night before our meeting, she called me late and sounded worried, apologetic, and unsure of whether she was ready to address difficult questions.

The book reveals the scandalous relationship between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, which began after the death of Princess Diana.\n\nFollowing Diana's tragic accident in 1997, Prince Charles proposed the idea of welcoming Bowles into the royal family, but Queen Elizabeth II was not pleased. According to Bower, the Queen referred to Bowles as \"that wicked woman\" and declared that she wanted \"nothing to do with her.\" The Queen was reportedly upset by Charles' relationship with Bowles during his marriage to Diana and would not forgive Bowles for not leaving Charles alone to work on their marriage.\n\nCharles was heartbroken by the Queen's rejection and called Bowles to deliver a \"tearful\" message. The Queen remained skeptical about the relationship for years, and it wasn't until 2005 that she gave her permission for Charles and Bowles to marry. However, the Queen did not want a big celebration for their union, and she nixed any plans for a large wedding reception. Charles was devastated by the smaller scale of the wedding and reportedly \"wallowed in gloom.\"\n\nDespite the Queen's initial disapproval, Bowles has slowly grown on her and she can now be seen standing alongside the royal family at public events and family outings. The couple was not allowed to marry in the Church of England, so they tied the knot at Windsor Town Hall before being blessed in St. George's Chapel, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be married on May 19.",

An added layer of sentiment came from being able to record the song in a Nashville studio, the city Taylor moved at age 14 to pursue country music.\" Spin has speculated on the reasons behind the edit, as well as Swift's alteration of the date in the song's opening line, which she changes from Sept. 21 to Sept. 28.\n\nSwift's comments on the other track remained unchanged in the press release: \"Delicate' is a song about the vulnerability that immediately surfaces in all of us the minute we meet someone we want to like us,\" it reads. \"We think about everything they might've heard about us, every reason they wouldn‚Äôt want us. Every step forward toward that other person scares us, but it thrills us too.

She's so smart and such a great girl and she'll figure it out.\"",

According to the Associated Press, Moore made the bold claim, \"I want Montana to be known as a decent state.\"\n\nDespite Moore's bizarre stance, the U.S. sales for yoga clothes have increased an astounding 45 percent year over year, while participation in yoga sports has only increased by a measly 4.5 percent. This means that more and more women are embracing athleisure wear as their go-to uniform, and for good reason - yoga pants are versatile, seasonless, and most importantly, comfortable.\n\nBut just because yoga pants are comfortable, doesn't mean they should be worn anywhere and everywhere. Here are some tips on how to wear yoga pants around town without getting the side-eye:\n\nDO: Learn from Lululemon's sheer pants recall. Make sure you select a pair that is truly opaque. Test them out in broad daylight or under bright lights.\n\nDON'T: Wear them to work. Ever. \"Dress Pant Yoga Pants\" is an oxymoron.\n\nDO: Invest in the correct size. It sounds like a no-brainer, but often women will purchase a size down to get a tighter fit or a longer shelf life since yoga pants stretch out. In reality, all you end up with is \"camel toe.\" Avoid at all costs.\n\nDON'T: Show your panty lines. If thongs aren't your thing, Commando and Zobha make great full-coverage bikini bottoms that are undetectable.\n\nDO: Layer up! Throwing on a leather jacket or a dark trench over your yoga pants and T-shirt will instantly dress up your look when you're running from bikram to brunch.\n\nDON'T: Keep wearing your favorite pair after the expiration date. Unlike jeans, yoga pants don't age well. Toss them when they're overly faded, stretched or ripped.\n\nDO: Accessorize! Nothing pulls together athleisure wear like a statement handbag and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nDON'T: Try to pull off your zaniest tie-dye yoga pants outside your ashtanga class. Stock up on neutral colors ‚Äî navy, black, charcoal ‚Äî that will go with anything.\n\nDO: Consider your tight-fitting yoga pants a thicker alternative to leggings in the wintertime. On the weekends, pair with knee-high boots and an oversized sweater, or wear them underneath a dress. No one will know the difference.\n\nTo shop the best yoga pants on the market, click on the slideshow below.",

The 32-year-old beauty flashed her never-ending legs in a pair of denim cut-off shorts, revealing her best Daisy Duke style. She paired the shorts with a lace cream shirt and trendy round sunglasses, exuding sophistication and style.\n\nAs Ashley met up with her Hollywood friend Cara Santana, the fianc√©e of former Desperate Housewives star Jesse Metcalfe, the actress's youthful appearance caught the attention of passersby. Ashley's long, dark hair was swept to one side, with a side fringe framing her face. Her cream lace shirt was nearly see-through, giving passersby a sneak peek at her black bra beneath. With a lace pattern along the body of the shirt, the garment buttoned up along the back.\n\nThe girls gathered around a mobile phone as they waited for the valet parking to take their car keys. Ashley sported one of the newest Chanel handbags, called the Flapbag, which will have set her bag a cool ¬£2110. Cara kept things a little more low-key with black skinny jeans and a blue denim jacket, following the recent trend for double denim in Hollywood. Black brogues with silver tips, a black leather rucksack, and her Quay Australia sunglasses finished off her street-styled outfit perfectly.\n\nAshley posted a picture of the girls' Japanese dinner from trendy West Hollywood restaurant Izaka-ya onto her Instagram account, saying: 'Hello old friend... I've missed you!' The actress's post received numerous likes and comments from her fans, who couldn't get enough of her stunning appearance.",

Following her Best Actress Oscar win for 2003‚Äôs Monster, Theron was offered plenty of roles in action movies, but none of them quite fit her desired image of a no-nonsense female assassin. That is, until she came across the opportunity to work with director Karyn Kusama on Aeon Flux.\n\n‚ÄúI got offered a lot of stuff in action movies that was either the girl behind the computer or the wife,‚Äù Theron revealed to Variety magazine. ‚ÄúWhen Aeon Flux came to me, I thought that could be something. I was never completely sold on the entire concept, but I really loved Karyn Kusama‚Äôs movie (Girlfight). So I threw myself into that with the belief that she‚Äôs a great filmmaker.‚Äù\n\nUnfortunately, their collaboration did not yield the desired results. The film received a lukewarm reception from critics and failed to make a significant impact at the box office. ‚ÄúAnd then we f**ked it all up,‚Äù Theron joked. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think we really knew how to execute it. And it‚Äôs disappointing, but it happens. I‚Äôve been in this business long enough to know that you cannot get it right every time.‚Äù\n\nDespite the setback, Theron was determined to take on the role of Lorraine Broughton in Atomic Blonde. And, after reading the script, she was immediately drawn to the character. ‚ÄúI might have gotten this right because of that (Aeon Flux),‚Äù Theron smiled. ‚ÄúYou know nothing about this woman. It‚Äôs so rare that a female gets that in a movie.‚Äù\n\nFinally, Theron has the opportunity to play the perfect female protagonist, a tough as nails spy, and she‚Äôs convinced that Atomic Blonde will be a hit among fans and critics alike. The actress is eager to show the world what she‚Äôs capable of and hopes that her fans will be just as excited as she is to see her take on this new challenge.",

Overall, the message contains several elements that raise doubts about its veracity.",
        "cs_rationale": "The message appears to blend factual elements with speculative or potentially fabricated details, making its overall veracity questionable. The initial claim of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's separation is plausible and has been previously reported. However, the assertion that Garner has been linked to the Church of Scientology lacks credible evidence and seems speculative. Moreover, the denial from Garner's representative about such claims further casts doubt on the accuracy of the Scientology association. The reference to Tom Cruise and a past proposal also lacks substantiation and appears sensationalized.

The character was the boyfriend of Joyce Byers and a father figure to Will, and his death was witnessed by many characters, including Joyce, Sheriff Hopper, and the main group of friends.\n\nDespite Bob's newbie status, Astin's performance as the character had already won over the creators and the rest of the cast. The Duffer Brothers had originally planned for Bob to die earlier in the season, but they had to push it back until episode eight. The death scene was described as the central heartbreaker of the season and served as a pivot point to the finale.\n\nExecutive producer Shawn Levy stated that hiring Astin was not initially a problem, as he believed Astin was an incredible actor and the part was not just about his past association with The Goonies. Levy added that the death scene was the hardest to write because of the emotional impact it had on the characters and the audience.\n\nAlthough Bob's death has not yet been avenged, the Duffers believe that the story will continue to unfold in its own way.

In an exclusive interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Keith Adams revealed that the entire stunt department was kept off set the day Thurman was allegedly pressured by director Quentin Tarantino to drive a vintage convertible at high speeds, resulting in a crash that left her with a concussion and damaged her knees.\n\n‚ÄúMs. Thurman‚Äôs accident was not a stunt,‚Äù Adams emphatically stated in an email to THR. ‚ÄúNo stunts were scheduled for that day, and no one from the stunt department was called to set. I was not consulted or notified about Ms. Thurman driving a car on camera that day.‚Äù\n\nAdams, an experienced coordinator with a specialization in automotive work, added that if he had been involved, he would have insisted on using a professional driver and ensuring the car was road-worthy and safe. He did not specify whether he believed the stunt department was intentionally kept at bay to facilitate an actor performing dangerous driving maneuvers.\n\nThurman herself has described the 1973 Karmann Ghia as a \"death box\" and claimed that the incident was the result of a cover-up by production executives. The stunt coordinator's new statement underscores Thurman's account of the incident and highlights the dangers of allowing actors to perform dangerous driving stunts on set.\n\nMany people share safety duties on set, including producers, directors, and the stunt coordinator. However, in this case, Adams admits that he did not have the opportunity to intervene when changes to the shoot were made, leaving the safety of the cast and crew at risk.\n\n‚ÄúOn any set, my number one priority is the safety of the cast and crew,‚Äù Adams said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, I did not have that opportunity in this case.‚Äù\n\nThis new revelation adds to the growing controversy surrounding the incident and raises serious questions about the safety protocols in place on set. The stunt coordinator's statement is a stark reminder of the risks actors face on set and the need for stricter safety measures to be put in place.",

According to Us Weekly, the two, who were together for nine months, have called it quits.\n\nTheir romance, which began on the set of their film The Light Between The Oceans in late 2014, was marked by several public displays of affection. However, it seems that their love has run its course.\n\nFassbender has a history of dating his co-stars, having been involved with his X-Men: First Class co-star Zoe Kravitz from 2010 to 2011, and with his Shame co-star Nicole Beharie. Vikander, on the other hand, has been cast in several high-profile films, including Burnt and the upcoming Bourne movie.\n\nDespite the end of their relationship, both Fassbender and Vikander are reportedly doing well in their respective careers. Fassbender will reprise his role of Steve Jobs in the upcoming film Steve Jobs, and Vikander will appear opposite Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller in Burnt.\n\nWhile the break-up is undoubtedly sad news, it is not the first Hollywood romance to end this year. Other high-profile couples, such as Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert, and Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith, have also announced their separations.\n\nAs for Fassbender and Vikander's reported split, it is not the first time that the couple have been rumored to be dating. In the past, they have been spotted together at various events, but have never confirmed their relationship.\n\nOverall, we wish both Fassbender and Vikander the best of luck in their future endeavors.",

        "cs_rationale": "Based on the message provided, there are several factors to consider in assessing its veracity:\n\n1. **Context and Plausibility**: The message talks about Matt Bomer expressing support for Wentworth Miller after Miller came out as gay. Matt Bomer is openly gay himself, which adds credibility to the statement that he would support another actor in a similar situation. The setting described (Heineken U.S. Open kickoff party at PH-D at Dream Downtown in New York) is specific and provides a plausible context for such statements to be made.\n\n2. **Content and Details**: The message includes specific details such as Bomer's comments on Miller's decision being bold and classy, as well as acknowledging positive legal changes for the LGBT community in the U.S. while highlighting ongoing challenges. These details enhance the credibility of the message as they are coherent with both Bomer's public persona and the broader social context.\n\n3. **Source and Attribution**: Although the message does not explicitly cite a direct interview or a verifiable publication, the details provided (location, occasion, specific statements) suggest it could have originated from a reliable entertainment news source or a firsthand account from someone present at the event.\n\nConsidering these points, the message appears to be plausible and consistent with what might be expected in such a context involving public figures discussing social issues.

And that's the best feeling in the entire world,\" she said.\n\nKristin also revealed that her daughter, Saylor, is a \"diva\" who loves to roughhouse and is very different from her brothers. \"She's a diva, but she's a ton of fun...She may as well be another boy because she's the third so she wants to do whatever the boys are doing.

The 20-year-old beauty, who gave birth to Stormi with boyfriend Travis Scott, stunned fans when she stepped out in a bikini just weeks after giving birth.\n\nHowever, despite her stunning post-baby body, Jenner admits that she is determined to shed the extra weight. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was spotted Snapchatting a video of someone cutting freshly baked rolls on April 5, with the caption: \"I need to lose 20 pounds but this just looks too good!\"\n\nJenner gave birth to her first child with Scott on February 1, and has been keeping a low profile since. However, she did reveal that she gained 40 pounds during her pregnancy in a since-deleted tweet. Despite the criticism, Jenner has shown off her post-baby body on multiple occasions, including at Tristan Thompson's birthday party and on her Snapchat.\n\nWhile some stars have the help of personal trainers and nutritionists to bounce back quickly after giving birth, Jenner's post-baby body is proof that it's possible to lose weight after having a baby.

She had just made her debut in the Australian film Bush Christmas that same year. Kidman's career in Australia would continue for a few more years, as she worked in both movies and TV.\n\nBut it was her international breakout role in 1989's Dead Calm that would change the course of her life. She portrayed the wife of a naval officer in the thrilling Australian thriller, and it was this movie that caught the attention of audiences worldwide and launched her into American cinema.\n\nHer arrival to the American movie industry was in the film Days of Thunder in 1990, where she met Tom Cruise, who would become her husband. They tied the knot on December 24, 1990, in Telluride, Colorado. They appeared together at the Academy Awards in 1991, where Kidman earned her first-ever Golden Globe nomination for her role in the film Billy Bathgate.\n\nHowever, their marriage was not meant to last. In February 2001, the couple announced their separation, and quickly after, they filed for divorce. It was a tough year for Kidman, but it was also a professional highlight, as her performance in the film Moulin Rouge earned her her first Oscar nomination and Golden Globe award, for best actress in a motion picture - musical or comedy.\n\nAfter her divorce from Cruise, Kidman found love again with the musician Lenny Kravitz, but their relationship was brief and intense. They were even engaged, but Kidman revealed in 2017 that they had called things off in 2004. Kidman spoke about a secret fianc√© to Vanity Fair in 2007, saying \"It just wasn't right. I wasn't ready. We weren't ready.\"\n\nThings are all good between Kidman and Kravitz now. She told NET-A-PORTER.com's magazine, The EDIT, \"I love Lenny; he's a great guy.\" In 2006, Kidman married her current husband, Keith Urban, in Sydney, Australia. They have two daughters together, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret. Kidman continued her career success, earning Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for her film Rabbit Hole in 2011, and a Golden Globe nod for her film The Paperboy in 2013. And her show Big Little Lies with Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz, the daughter of her ex-fianc√© Lenny Kravitz, earned her critical acclaim and numerous nominations. The past decade has been a big one for Kidman, and she is still as strong as ever with Urban by her side.",

        "content": "The biggest fashion faux pas for a wedding guest would be to upstage the bride. With all the attention and speculation surrounding Kate Middleton's gown for her upcoming royal wedding, it would be nearly impossible to do. However, there are other unwritten rules that guests should consider. Don't wear white, anything too revealing, or a hat that is too wide or tall to block the view of the person behind you. You can wear tasteful black, and be sure to cover your arms.\n\n\"This is not a place to make a fashion statement for yourself,\" said Sally Kilbridge, deputy editor of Brides magazine. She goes on to list more don'ts, including no miniskirts, plunging necklines, and novelty socks, which have become a surprising trend among guests at American weddings. The attire worn to a British royal wedding is appropriate daytime wedding attire kicked up many notches, Kilbridge said. Everyone's outfit should be chic, elegant, and suit the very formal, traditional occasion while not letting glitzy, black-tie, eveningwear trappings creep in.\n\nDesigner Reem Acra thinks Westminster Abbey could be the place for cocktail frocks, especially for celebrities and fashion editors who have long found reason to wear them before noon. The fashion role model for older women should be well-cut, luxe-fabric skirt suits, while Middleton's younger friends could pull off slightly retro, Hitchcock-inspired sheaths or pencil skirts paired with nipped-waist jackets. George Kotsiopoulos, co-host of E!'s Fashion Police, expects a lot of hats, but hopes they'll be toned-down cloches or a pillbox with a veil.\n\nVivien Sheriff, a British milliner who has made several dozen custom headpieces for wedding guests, said many guests will follow the lead of Middleton's mother, Carole, who is a fan of substantial hats. The hats Sheriff has made feature some feathers and crystals, but they're not oversized. \"You can't show off too much. You don't want to overdo it, but there is a lot of expression in the headpieces.\" Sheriff added that people aren't going to want to hide their faces, so the brims won't cover them. \"This way, everyone can get good photos and you can greet other guests looking them in the eye.\"\n\nThere will be more black than one might expect, Sheriff said. She had more orders for black than she expected. \"I guess fashion has changed and a lot of young guests want to wear black.\" However, black is fine as long as it's not funereal, according to Brides' Kilbridge, although the Middleton family won't wear it. Prince Charles' wife, Camilla, won't wear it either, Kilbridge predicted. Camilla will likely pluck something she already had in her closet, Kilbridge said, probably something not unlike the tailored dress and lovely coat she wore to her own wedding.\n\nMost of the male guests will likely don a navy or gray morning suit, which is basically the daytime equivalent of a tuxedo including a vest or waistcoat. All of William's military friends will be in uniform, Kilbridge said. A guest with a well-known personal style has a little more flexibility, said Kilbridge. It would be perfectly acceptable for Elton John, for example, to wear a flashy, embroidered vest under his jacket. Fashion fans will be eager to see David and Victoria Beckham, and Kilbridge thinks they won't disappoint, although she wonders how Victoria Beckham will dress her baby bump. \"They've had some crazy fashion moments, but this won't be one of them. She'll probably look fantastic. They want to create the impression that she belongs there. I think most people will be striving to look like they belong.\" That might have singer Joss Stone, who is famously barefoot almost everywhere she goes, digging to the bottom of her closet looking for a pair of shoes.",

Furthermore, Page Six reported that Jolie had developed an \"insane jealousy\" of Amal Clooney, which caused her to believe that Amal has stolen her identity as the world's most glamorous and admired humanitarian.\n\nDespite these negative headlines, Jolie also published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency's efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children. The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.\n\nIn her piece, Jolie shared moving accounts of what education means to children whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war. She met these girls during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can't read or write, and has been \"robbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.\"\n\nJolie argues that wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war by providing resources such as school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.

I delivered the baby! I delivered her. I pulled her out.\"\n\nBut that's not all. Kris also shared that Kylie didn't feel much pain during the delivery. \"She just kept saying, 'I don't feel any pain,'\" Kris said. \"And you'd see the contractions like crazy and she would say, 'I'm just not feeling it,' and I would say, 'This is really weird.'\"\n\nKris's revelation comes as a surprise, as People magazine first reported Kylie's pregnancy news back in September 2017.

What‚Äôs at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society. The Board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.\"\n\nMia Farrow, whose son Ronan recently published a New Yorker investigation with rape and sexual assault allegations against Weinstein's, took to Twitter to express her support of the board's decision.

Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual assault by numerous actresses, becomes the second person ever to be kicked out of the Academy, after Godfather actor Carmine Caridi, who was removed in 2004 for illegally sharing Oscar screeners.\n\nThe Weinstein Company, which he helped to found, has fired him, and his wife, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Weinstein's brother Bob spoke of his \"waking nightmare\" and expressed his desire for his brother to receive \"the justice he deserves.\"\n\nThe fallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal continues more than a week after an explosive New York Times investigation detailed decades of sexual harassment accusations against Weinstein.

The women stood together in solidarity, calling for greater representation and equal opportunities in the film industry.\n\nIn a joint statement, Blanchett and French director Agnes Varda emphasized the need for transparency and parity in executive bodies and work environments. They called for governments to enforce equal pay laws and for workplaces to be diverse and equitable. The women also acknowledged the efforts of those standing for change and called for the industry's stairways to be accessible to all.\n\nThe protest was part of the 5050x2020 movement, which seeks to achieve gender parity across all aspects of the film industry by the year 2020. The number 82 was selected to match the number of films directed by women in the festival's history, with only 4.3% of competition films in the past 71 years being directed by women.\n\nOther notable women involved in the protest included Salma Hayek, Marion Cotillard, director Patty Jenkins, and Haifaa al-Mansour. The protest was organized by French group Le Deuxieme Regard and the 5050x2020 collective, in collaboration with the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe protest comes in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #MeToo and Time's Up movements, which have sparked a renewed demand for change in the film industry. The movement also echoes broader calls for gender equality and diversity in the workplace.\n\nWhile progress has been made in recent years, with more women making the cut in competition, the statistics for women in Cannes are still dismal. Only one woman has won the Palme d'Or, and only one woman has been named Best Director. The festival has been criticized for its lack of diversity and inclusion, and for failing to provide a platform for women filmmakers.\n\nHowever, the rise of women in the film industry is undeniable, and the protest at Cannes highlights the need for continued efforts to promote gender equality and diversity in the industry. As the movement continues to gain momentum, it remains to be seen what concrete actions will be taken to address these issues and create a more inclusive and equitable film industry.",

The news surprised fans who had been speculating about the couple's potential divorce for months.\n\nAccording to a report by Radar Online, several factors contributed to the decision to end their marriage. One of these was Tatum's desire to have more children. Despite being the parents of a daughter, Everly, Tatum reportedly wanted a larger family. However, Dewan was not on board with this idea. A previous report by OK!

Although Tatum was earning enough money to support the family, he wanted Dewan to be at home with Everly so she would not be raised by nannies. However, Dewan reportedly grew tired of being a housewife while Tatum spent his time on movie sets.\n\nAdditionally, jealousy is said to have played a role in the separation. As Tatum's fame increased with films such as 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, and its sequels, he became a sex symbol in Hollywood, attracting numerous women. Sources claim that Dewan was uncomfortable with the way Tatum interacted with fans, including flirting with them in front of her.\n\nIn an official statement released via social media, Tatum and Dewan announced their separation and stated that they would not be making further comments on the matter.",

Obama confessed that he misses cinema, adding, \"We call it a movie theatre, but that's fine.\" When Harry asked about boxers or briefs, Obama simply said, \"Sorry - we don't answer those questions.\"\n\nIn another exchange, Obama revealed his love for basketball player Michael Jordan, while Harry asked about his preference between LeBron James and Jordan. Obama responded, \"Jordan - although I love LeBron - but I'm a Chicago guy.\"\n\nThe conversation also included Obama's thoughts on music, with Harry asking him who he considers the best: Aretha Franklin or Tina Turner. Obama confidently said, \"Aretha is the best.\"\n\nWhen Harry asked about his favorite TV shows, Obama named \"Suits\" as his favorite, to which Harry replied, \"Of course.\" Obama then revealed his love for cigarettes, but has since switched to gum.\n\nOverall, the conversation was a lighthearted and unexpected exchange between two high-profile figures, and provided a glimpse into their shared interests and sense of humor.",
