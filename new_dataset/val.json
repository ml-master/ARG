He is still protected by 'family members' in Brazil. They've told lies to papers to try to silence me. To finally speak out and not be afraid. To everyone still suffering silently, you never asked for it. NOBODY DOES. I do this for my son. So that he will see one day that we all have a voice. And that this behavior can not be tolerated any longer.\"\n\nThe actress, who plays Effy Stonem in the show, revealed that she kept her assault a secret for a decade, only sharing her story with her son.\n\nBut in a recent interview with Metro.Co.UK, Scodelario revealed that the response to her bravery had been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nShe said: \"The response was wonderful. I am now dealing with a new side of it, which is this. I will be asked about it forever now. I hope it doesn't define me but it will always be under my name and I accept that – but I am proud I was brave enough to do it and I am grateful for the support I had from friends.\"\n\nScodelario also revealed that her 12-year-old self was the driving force behind her decision to speak out.\n\nShe said: \"I remember thinking that if I was 12-years-old and I had this horrific thing happen to me but I saw a woman I admired speaking up about it, it would have made me feel less guilty, and it would have inspired me to think 'this won't hold me back, this is something that has happened but I am not a victim.' So I thought if I can do that for one person then I owe it to my 12-year-old self.\"\n\nScodelario joins a growing list of women who have bravely come forward with their own stories of abuse, as the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across the world.\n\nActress Michelle Williams brought #MeToo founder Tarana Burke to the Golden Globes and opened up about navigating the uncertain times to help create a better world for the next generation, including her own 12-year-old daughter, Matilda Rose Ledger.\n\n\"I thought I would have to raise my daughter to learn how to protect herself in a dangerous world, but I think the work that Tarana has done and the work that I'm learning how to do — we actually have the opportunity to hand our children a different world,\" Williams said on the E! red carpet pre-show. \"I am honored beyond measure to be standing next to this woman.

Doherty brought him to an adoption event just outside Toronto, where Meghan was living while filming Suits. Little did they know, Meghan was one of the hopeful dog owners.\n\nGuy's journey didn't end there.

Specific details can sometimes suggest credibility, but they can also be fabricated to make the story more believable.\n\n2. **Source of Information**: The message refers to an \"on-set observer\" without specifying who this observer is or providing any verifiable source.

The actor, currently starring in the London revival of Tony Kushner's Pulitzer-winning drama Angels in America, stunned the crowd at the drag show Werq the World, where he joined forces with co-stars Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and Russell Tovey.\n\nAs the show unfolded, Garfield found himself on the stage during the \"Wig in a Box\" segment, where he and three other audience members were called upon to wear wigs of iconic singers and engage in a lip-syncing battle. With no hesitation, the 33-year-old Amazing Spider-Man star chose Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You,\" leaving the other competitors to lip-sync Cher, Dolly Parton, and Katy Perry.\n\nThe audience was left breathless as Garfield donned the curly brunette wig, throwing himself into the performance with a contagious energy. He even delighted the crowd with a back flip during the show. After the performance, Michelle Visage, the drag race panelist, shared a photograph of herself embracing Garfield and Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox, captioning it with pride, \"Andrew Garfield, you are my new friend, I am SO proud of you for not just lip syncing Whitney tonight in a wig no less, but for opening your mind and heart to all it has to offer.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Garfield has donned drag. In 2014, he stunned in a long blonde wig and a lace white dress for Arcade Fire's music video for \"We Exist.\" His bravery and willingness to embrace the unknown have earned him newfound respect and appreciation from fans around the world.",

On the drama side, The Handmaid's Tale, the freshman series that took home several awards in its first year, is once again in the running for Outstanding Drama Series. The grim, dystopian adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel was praised for its Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series. Additionally, the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series prize will be awarded to series star Elisabeth Moss, who has finally won an Emmy after seven prior nominations.\n\nOn the comedy side, the nominations field is crowded with eight series vying for the main prize. However, reigning champ Veep is missing as the show's final season was delayed while its star, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, underwent treatment for cancer. Among the contenders for the Outstanding Comedy Series throne are newcomer The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and the second season of Donald Glover's Atlanta. The rest of the Outstanding Comedy Series nominees include Barry, GLOW, Silicon Valley, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nWhile some shows were overlooked in certain categories, Killing Eve's star, Sandra Oh, made history as the first woman of Asian descent to be nominated for a Lead Actress Emmy.\n\nNBC will broadcast the 2018 Emmy Awards show live on Monday, with Saturday Night Live's Colin Jost and Michael Che hosting. The complete list of nominees can be found on the Emmys' website.\n\nAs the night of recognition approaches, let us take a moment to reflect on the emotional impact of television. From the laughter and tears that come with binge-watching a new show to the heartbreak and hope that comes with watching a character's journey unfold, television has the power to bring us together in a way that no other medium can.\n\nHere's to the winners and nominees of the 2018 Emmy Awards.

This level of detail and specificity suggests that the information is based on an actual observation or report, rather than being a completely made-up story.\n\nAdditionally, the message acknowledges the ambiguity around whether this is a new romantic relationship, indicating a degree of caution and objectivity in the reporting. This suggests that the author is attempting to provide a balanced and factual account, rather than sensationalizing the situation.\n\nFurthermore, the mention of Anwar Hadid's previous relationship with Nicola Peltz adds plausibility to the report, as it provides relevant context and background information about one of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, the level of detail, the cautious wording, and the inclusion of relevant background information all contribute to the impression that this is more likely to be a real and accurate report, rather than a fabricated story.

It's generally considered a tabloid-style publication which may sensationalize or exaggerate stories.\n\n2. **Plausibility of Events**: Good Charlotte is a well-known band, and it's plausible that they could go on tour, especially if they have a new album (\"Generation Rx\"). The idea of celebrities influencing their spouses to tour is also within the realm of possibility.\n\n3. **Lack of Specific Evidence**: The message mentions struggling ticket sales but doesn't provide specific data or evidence (like actual ticket sales figures or venue capacities). This lack of detail makes it harder to verify the claim.\n\n4. **Nature of the Claim**: The claim itself (ticket sales struggling despite efforts) is plausible for any touring band, especially if there's competition or market factors affecting ticket sales.\n\nGiven these points, while the core claim (band touring and ticket sales struggling) is plausible, the specific details provided lack substantiation.

Despite the attention, Jenner is hoping that once the baby is born, the level of interest will decrease.

This lends credibility to the message as it provides verifiable information.\n\n2. **Logical Consistency**: The message discusses contrasting observations (Jenner's appearance suggesting pregnancy vs. her Calvin Klein campaign suggesting otherwise), which shows a balanced viewpoint and awareness of potential contradictions. This adds to the credibility as it acknowledges different perspectives.\n\n3. **Mentions of Rumors**: Acknowledging persistent rumors of Jenner's pregnancy without affirming them outright suggests caution and factual reporting. This approach is typical of credible reporting, where unverified claims are clearly distinguished from confirmed facts.\n\n4. **Style and Language**: The message uses a formal and factual tone, characteristic of journalistic reporting. It avoids sensationalism and maintains a neutral stance, presenting evidence and leaving room for speculation without making definitive claims.\n\nConsidering these points, the message appears to be more likely a real report rather than fabricated or misleading information.

The subsequent mention of \"rumors of her pregnancy\" also fits the pattern of how celebrity news and speculation often unfolds in the media.\n\nThe message then goes on to report on Jenner's recent public appearance, providing specific details such as the date, the individuals she was accompanied by, and the fact that photographic evidence was published by a reputable entertainment news outlet (TMZ). This level of detail and corroboration with an external source lends credibility to the overall narrative.\n\nFurthermore, the message acknowledges the ambiguity surrounding Jenner's pregnancy status, noting that while her appearance may suggest she is pregnant, her past behavior and recent professional engagements (the Calvin Klein campaign) could also indicate otherwise. This balanced and nuanced approach to the reporting suggests a well-informed and objective perspective, rather than a sensationalized or fabricated account.\n\nOverall, the level of detail, the use of specific facts and dates, the reference to external sources, and the balanced treatment of the subject matter lead me to conclude that this message is more likely to be a real, factual report rather than a fabricated one.

According to a new interview with The Talk, Smith maintains that he never asked for the footage to be aired and that he had a conversation with Jeff Probst about how he wanted to handle his story.\n\nSmith explained that he was drawn to Survivor because of the show's integrity in storytelling, and that he only revealed his trans status later in the relationship. He had a chat with Probst and they agreed that how and when he would talk about his trans identity was up to him, not the show.\n\nBut after being outed by fellow contestant Jeff Varner, Smith says he had unprecedented autonomy in how he wanted to tell his story. He even wrote a personal essay about the incident and says he was proud of how he responded. Smith also believes that by sharing his story, something good can come of it and that maybe it won't happen to someone else.\n\nSo who really outed Zeke Smith? Smith's interview with The Talk doesn't give away who is responsible, leaving many questions unanswered. It seems that CBS should take some responsibility and do the same.\"",

Swift was not at home at the time of either arrest.\n\nIn related news, another man who violated a restraining order and threatened to kill Swift was sentenced to 10 years probation in early April.

It cites sources from RadarOnline.com claiming she is still deeply affected by the situation, comparing her situation unfavorably to Kathy Griffin's.

The DC Entertainment series, which was axed in May, averaged a 1.3 rating among adults 18-49 and nearly 5 million viewers in its third season. Despite a massive fan campaign, Netflix has decided to revive the show for a fourth season, leaving many to wonder why such a beloved series was cancelled in the first place.\n\n\"Lucifer\" never really set the ratings afire, but it had a dedicated fan base that fought hard to keep the show alive. The series ended on a cliffhanger, leaving fans heartbroken and creators gutted. Creator Joe Henderson tweeted out that the axing \"fucking hurts,\" and star Tom Ellis tweeted that he was \"gutted\" by the cancellation.\n\nAs Netflix picks up the show, it is clear that the Peak TV era offers more choices where one outlet's miss is another's hit. It also is worth noting that Netflix didn't even have the SVOD rights to \"Lucifer\" - Hulu did - meaning that deal had to be reworked, similar to the way Amazon recently revived Syfy's \"The Expanse\" after having to renegotiate SVOD rights as the first three seasons were sold to Netflix.\n\nThis cancellation comes as Fox undergoes a dramatic shift amid its studio counterpart's pending sale to Disney (or Comcast). Gone are niche comedies like \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" and narrow dramas like \"Lucifer,\" as Fox plots a shift to broader audiences with a slate of procedurals and multicamera comedies.

However, despite their efforts, Venezia could not be saved and was pronounced dead at the hospital later that day.\n\nAutopsy results reported Wednesday revealed that he suffered no fractures, but the news of his sudden and tragic death has left his friends and family devastated.\n\n\"I'm going to miss you so much Zander!\" said Nolan, who watched Venezia's last surf and described him as \"humble, respectful, full of positive energy.\"\n\n\"Gone too soon,\" he continued. \"My heart is heavy.

Talty is the New York Times-bestselling author of six nonfiction books focused on history and individual achievement.

(Alas, it's not too late to book your ticket now to London—you won't be able to attend the wedding itself, but you can still sort of camp out nearby and listen for sounds.)\n\nThere are countless spreadsheets and binders dedicated to making sure everything goes smoothly for Kate's sister's nuptials, and most of the plans remain shrouded in secrecy. And there are so many questions about the wedding itself, including what Pippa will be wearing, and what Kate's exact role will be, and whether or not we will be gifted with a shot of Meghan Markle and Prince George shaking hands. But what we do know, per a new E! report, is how Pippa, reportedly, has been preparing for the wedding.\n\nThe outlet claims that Pippa has undergone a \"strict bridal body boot camp,\" a three-month program run out of Grace Belgravia health club. The program, in its description, doesn't sound too different from an (intensive) gym membership that you might read about a famous person partaking in; the components include \"a personal trainer, skincare and leg toning treatments, plus yoga, pilates, spinning, cardio training, dance and meditation classes\" and \"the club also offers to arrange home deliveries of specialized healthy meals.\"\n\nOh, wait, there's also this, which sounds positively Paltrow-ian: \"The club also has a team of doctors and specialists who can help with anti-aging treatments including botox, peels, fillers, microdermabrasion and an assortment of laser treatments, as well as IV therapies.\" E! notes, of course, that it is \"unclear if Pippa has undergone such procedures.\"\n\nTheir source claims that Pippa has \"met with her PT about five times a week and mostly sticks to cardio and pilates.\" Per the source: \"She feels amazing. Her diet is the healthiest ever—she hasn't even had a glass of wine in months. She's had facial treatments sometimes once a week or once a fortnight.\"\n\nThis truly is an impressive feat, as, just over the course of writing this post, we have finished off two glasses of wine and did not complete a single facial treatment.",

From there, things moved quickly.\n\nThree dates in, Jonas called Chopra's mother to let her know that he was going to propose. The singer then shut down a Tiffany & Co store in London so that he could pick out the perfect ring, and whisked her off to Crete for her birthday. He waited until midnight to propose, so that their engagement anniversary would not overlap with her birthday celebrations.\n\n\"I got down on one knee, again, and I said: 'Will you make me the happiest man in the world and marry me?'

After the wedding, Hough and Laich donated all the flowers to The Full Bloom, a non-profit organization that repurposes gently used flowers into bouquets for patients in area hospitals, hospice care and other facilities.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Hough wore a custom strapless sweetheart Marchesa gown and Laich wore a Brooks Brothers tuxedo. They exchanged traditional vows and exchanged Lorraine Schwartz-designed rings. \"Brooks and I kept eye contact the entire ceremony,\" Hough said. \"We never stopped looking at each other.\" Her favorite moment was \"kissing each other for the first time as husband and wife as the confetti cannons exploded around us.\"\n\nAfter the ceremony, Hough was surprised by her bridesmaids and girlfriends with a choreographed dance number to Sia's song, \"The Greatest,\" a favorite from Hough's recent tour with her brother, Derek. The bride surprised her groom as well — with timed fireworks over the lake during their first dance to OneRepublic's \"All This Time\" (to which she also walked down the aisle).\n\nGuests were given turn-down gifts each night, put together from the bride and groom by Gifts for the Good Life, which included a Happy Spritz facial mist, Sugarfina Bubbly Bears with a J&B monogrammed label, and a make-your-own margarita set with Casamigos Tequila or make-your-own lemonade kit, among other goodies.\n\nHough and Laich announced their engagement in August 2015 after dating for a year and a half. Their wedding weekend was \"perfection,\" Hough said. \"I don't think I ever really necessarily dreamed about my wedding as a kid. But I know I will always cherish and remember it for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThis story is a reminder that love is the most beautiful thing in the world, and that true love knows no bounds.

However, his battle with addiction led him to take drastic steps.\n\nThe former Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman's death was ruled an apparent suicide, but Vicky Cornell and others argue that there is more to the story. Medical reports found seven different drugs in his system, but these were not a contributing factor to his death.\n\nDr. Richard Cote, the chair of the department of pathology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, conducted an independent analysis of Chris Cornell's autopsy and revealed that two drugs found in his system may have resulted in impaired judgment and motor functions.\n\nVicky Cornell also revealed that her husband fell back into addiction approximately a year before his death, after being sober since 2003. He took 20-something pills in a week and 33 pills in nine days.\n\nThe new drugs changed him, she said, and his brain became different from that of someone who doesn't have a substance use disorder. He relapsed, and just two months later, he walked off stage in the middle of what would turn out to be his final performance and died hours later in his hotel room.\n\nVicky Cornell said explaining what happened to her children the following day was \"the most tragic thing you can ever go through.\" She added that she is now making it her mission to raise awareness and destigmatize addiction, and encourage others to speak openly about the topic.\n\n“People think that addiction is like, ‘Oh, you were an addict,'” she said. “People don’t recognize it as a disease.”\n\n“You think addiction is a choice, and it's not,” she added. “I think that if there was less stigma around it, more people would speak up.”\n\nShe added that addiction has now \"crossed over all sorts of socioeconomic boundaries ... it's everywhere.\"\n\n“My husband was the furthest thing from a rock star junkie.

She notes that Prince William and Kate Middleton did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite their public divorce. Even though three of the Queen's children have divorced, none had a prenuptial agreement.\n\nWhile there is a large sum of money involved in the marriage, the Queen holds the majority of the royal property and fortune, estimated to be worth around $500 million, compared to Prince Harry's estimated $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own wealth as an actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode.\n\nIf Meghan and Harry divorce, negotiations would likely take place outside of court, as is the case with Diana's divorce. Although prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they are not legally enforceable.\n\nRoyal splits have tried to make as few waves as possible in modern times, with the divorce described as amicable for PR reasons.

These two competitors, who faced off in the season 25 finale, have found a new family in the DWTS community. As they prepare to co-host the pint-sized version of the competition, they reflect on their journey and the love they've found along the way.\n\n\"The opening number of the premiere episode on Sunday, I think people are going to fall in love,\" Muniz told reporters on the red carpet after the season finale. \"They’re going to go, 'Oh, this is for real. They can dance.'\" The 12 celebrity kids, ranging in age from 9 to 14, have brought Muniz and Fisher closer together, and they're excited to see them succeed. \"It is a true black hole of love, warmth, and genuinely rooting for each other,\" Fisher says of the DWTS family. \"They’ve built this community unlike anything that I’ve ever seen, and they’ve all remained in each other’s lives.\"\n\nThe difference between this season and the original DWTS is striking. Juniors was pre-taped over the summer, allowing the kids to be out of school and giving the pro dancers the opportunity to serve as mentors. Cheryl Burke, Witney Carson, Sasha Farber, Lindsay Arnold, and Artem Chigvintsev are just a few of the pros who will be guiding the young dancers. The judging panel, too, has fresh faces, with Mandy Moore, Val Chmerkovskiy, and Adam Rippon joining forces to give the kids valuable feedback.\n\n\"It is a little bit different with the adults,\" Fisher admits. \"You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel. With the kids, I was so grateful that we had the judges that we did. Adam, Mandy, and Val did an unbelievable job at getting across some points they needed to get across, but from a place of nurture and of love and of expecting to see growth on the other end.\"\n\nThe kids have responded well to the critiques from the judges, and Fisher is proud of the progress they've made. \"I feel like it’s a little bit different with the adults,\" he says. \"You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel.

It’s wherever the builders have put it, and I’m hoping that it’s in a safe place.\"\n\nDancing with the Stars: Juniors debuts Sunday, Oct. 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.

He noted that during the past decade, things had changed, and it should not be \"so easy for one demented person to kills so many people so quickly.\"\n\nJames Corden, an Englishman who has lived in the US for just over two and a half years, noted that the killings in Las Vegas were the second time in 21/2 years that the record for mass shooting deaths had been broken. He questioned how it was that every other developed country did a better job of preventing mass shootings, given the widespread availability of guns.\n\n\"Maybe the time for the thoughts and prayers of Congress members and the president has passed,\" Corden said. \"We need to look to them to actually do something to prevent this from happening in the future.\"\n\nDespite the somber mood, Corden also noted that even in these \"strange times,\" they had a show to do, hoping to bring some levity to the most heavy of days.",

Joel tells Khloe that he was always there for Jose during the leukemia thing, but Jose doesn't even care about him. That's when Khloe shuts him down!\n\n\"It's not just about a hot body.

The stunning starlet donned a variety of designer ensembles, each more breathtaking than the last.\n\nFor her first appearance, Gomez paired a Jacquemus mini dress with the crystal flower sandals she loves, a Louis Vuitton item that costs a staggering $1,060. The ensemble, which cost nearly $2,000, was loose at the top and fitted through the body with a large button accenting the crossover V-neckline and split skirt.\n\nNext, Gomez stunned in a bright orange dress from Christopher Kane's pre-Fall 2017 collection, her crystal sandals adding a pop of color to her bold look. Her outfit was complemented by a deep V-neckline and a side slit.\n\nAfter her appearance on the Elvis Duran and The Morning Show, Gomez changed into a black slip dress over a white tunic, her crystal sandals adding a touch of glamour to her casual but chic look. Her ensemble was styled with Tura Inc sunglasses and her signature Vuitton heels.\n\nFor her next appearance, Gomez stunned in a neon pink-and-white printed polo shirt and pants set from Miu Miu's Fall 2017 ready-to-wear collection, her crystal sandals adding a playful touch to her sporty but sophisticated look. She traded in her signature heels for a pair of silver Gianvito Rossi sandals.\n\nFinally, Gomez wrapped up her busy day with a long black-and-white striped dress and leather jacket, her crystal sandals completing the edgy but elegant look.

The mention of additional security measures like motion sensors and lasers at their mansion further supports the notion that they prioritize safety, given their wealth and status.\n\nThe details about the birth of their twins at a luxurious hospital wing also align with the lifestyle of celebrities who can afford such amenities. The mention of a security driver hired at £100,000 per year adds credibility to the extent of their security arrangements.\n\nMoreover, the presence of a spokesperson confirming the health and well-being of their children is typical in celebrity news reporting, adding to the overall authenticity of the message.\n\nConsidering these points, the message appears coherent and fits within the expected behaviors and expenditures of high-profile individuals like George Clooney and Amal Clooney.

        "content": "The meteoric rise of Donald Trump and his seemingly unbeatable political prowess have left many experts stumped, seeking an explanation as to how this occurred. To fully understand this phenomenon, we must not only examine Trump himself, but also his devoted supporters, whose unwavering admiration and devotion to their unpredictable and often inflammatory leader baffles many.\n\nPsychologists and neuroscientists have provided numerous thought-provoking explanations for Trump's enduring support, but the accounts of these experts often vary greatly, sometimes overlapping and other times conflicting. However insightful these critiques may be, it is clear that further research and examination are needed to pinpoint the exact psychological and social factors driving this bizarre behavior.\n\nIn a recent review paper published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, UC Santa Cruz professor Thomas Pettigrew argues that five major psychological phenomena can help explain this exceptional political event.\n\n1. Authoritarianism: This refers to the advocacy or enforcement of strict obedience to authority, often at the expense of personal freedom. Those with authoritarian personality syndrome, a prevalent condition, often display aggression toward outgroup members, submissiveness to authority, resistance to new experiences, and a rigid hierarchical view of society. Trump's speeches, with their absolutist terms like \"losers\" and \"disasters,\" naturally appeal to those who prefer authoritarianism. Research has shown that Republican voters scored higher on measures of authoritarianism before Trump's rise, and a 2016 survey found that high authoritarians greatly favored Trump, leading to his election win.\n\n2. Social dominance orientation (SDO): This refers to people who prefer a societal hierarchy where high-status groups have dominance over low-status ones. Those with SDO are typically dominant, tough-minded, and driven by self-interest. Trump appeals to those with SDO by making clear distinctions between high-status groups (White) and low-status groups (immigrants and minorities). A survey found that those who scored high on both SDO and authoritarianism were those who intended to vote for Trump.\n\n3. Prejudice: While not all Trump supporters are prejudiced against ethnic and religious minorities, some certainly are. The Republican party has long used strategies that appeal to bigotry, such as \"dog whistles\" that signal prejudice to racists but not to others. Trump's shockingly direct appeals to bigoted supporters, such as calling Muslims \"dangerous\" and Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"murderers,\" likely play a role in his popularity. A new study shows that support for Trump is correlated with a standard scale of modern racism.\n\n4. Intergroup contact: Contact with members of groups outside one's own has been shown to reduce prejudice. However, Trump's white supporters have experienced significantly less contact with minorities than other Americans. A study found that the racial and ethnic isolation of Whites at the zip-code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support, and this correlation persisted while controlling for dozens of other variables. Support for Trump increased with voters' physical distance from the Mexican border.\n\n5. Relative deprivation: This refers to the experience of feeling deprived of something one believes they are entitled to. Trump supporters who feel that American jobs are being lost to Mexico and China may be experiencing relative deprivation, particularly in swing states like Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This kind of deprivation is based on a skewed perception of entitlement, rather than an absolute lack of resources.\n\nThese psychological phenomena help explain the peculiar behavior of Trump's supporters, but further research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.",

The story, as described by Liam Payne in an interview, suggests a specific sequence of events involving a request from Trump, refusal by the band's manager, and subsequent expulsion from the hotel.\n\nTo assess its likelihood of being real:\n1. **Specific Details**: The message provides specific details such as Trump calling their room and the manager declining the request. This adds some credibility.\n   \n2. **Source**: The claim is attributed to an interview with Liam Payne in Rollacoaster magazine, which would need verification to confirm its authenticity.\n\n3. **Plausibility**: While the incident could feasibly happen, it also could be a fabricated or exaggerated story for publicity or other reasons.\n\n4. **Contextual Clarity**: The message lacks direct evidence or corroboration beyond Payne's statement, making it reliant on the trustworthiness of the source.\n\nGiven these points, without further corroborative evidence, the veracity of the message remains uncertain.

Despite claims that Meghan was present at the reception, no images have emerged to support this.\n\nIn the build-up to the wedding, there were reports that Meghan was advised not to wear anything similar to Pippa or Kate to avoid upstaging them. However, Meghan did not attend the ceremony.\n\nPippa and Meghan are rarely seen together, which has led some to speculate that they may be trying to avoid each other on the wedding day. Dr. Nyla Raja, a cosmetic dermatology GP and founder of Wilmslow Medispa, Manchester, believes that there may be similarities in their facial features, such as a similar eye shape, high cheekbones, and differences in lip size and jawline.\n\nHarry and Meghan have not revealed the guest list for their wedding reception, but it is expected to be significantly smaller than Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding at Westminster Abbey. The couple's closest friends, family, and celebrities, such as the Beckhams, Millie Mackintosh, and tennis star Serena Williams, are expected to attend.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Meghan reportedly attended a friend's wedding in Jamaica this weekend.

The 38-year-old was taken to the emergency room by her beau Geno and daughter Alana after she woke up without vision in both eyes.\n\nAfter examining her, a doctor revealed that Mama June was suffering from a detached retina and needed immediate surgery. The reality star was understandably worried about the procedure, as she feared she might lose her sight in her good eye. \"What if I lose sight in my good eye? I went totally blind in my right eye four years ago!\" she exclaimed.\n\nDespite her fears, Mama June underwent the surgery and it was a success. She was able to return home to recover, but there was still a 50/50 chance that she would regain sight. The family, including pregnant daughter Pumpkin, were overjoyed to have her back home, and Pumpkin even moved back into the house to help her mother in her recovery.\n\nHowever, there was also trouble in paradise. Mama June's ex-husband Sugar Bear was extremely upset because he believed that she was trying to keep their daughter Alana away from him. He left an angry message on the phone, screaming, \"You're a damn b*tch, June. Last time you're gonna mess with me.\" He even decided to throw bricks at a picture of Mama June.\n\nIn other drama, Sugar Bear's girlfriend Jennifer received a paternity test in the mail, as she didn't believe that he was Alana's birth father. The episode ended with Jennifer getting the results, and it was unclear what the future held for the family.",

Pitt will have custody of the children from June 8 to June 17, for four hours per day, while he stays in London, where Jolie is renting a house.

From July 21 to July 29, Pitt will resume custody of the children when he returns to California. The court noted that if the minor children remain closed off to their father, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with Jolie and may lead to primary physical custody being ordered in Pitt's favor.\n\nJolie's spokesperson has expressed disappointment at the release of confidential court records, stating that it is not in the best interests of the children.

Star magazine is known for sensational and often speculative reporting, which reduces the reliability of the information presented.\n\n2. **Lack of Confirmation**: There's no confirmation from reliable or official sources like representatives of the Kardashians, the event organizers, or credible news outlets. Without multiple verifiable sources, the credibility of the claim is questionable.\n\n3. **Inconsistencies and Speculation**: The message includes speculative reasons for the alleged ban (Kris Jenner's behavior and alcohol consumption) without concrete evidence or statements from involved parties. Such details could easily be exaggerated or fabricated.\n\n4. **Contradictory Information**: While the message mentions some Kardashians' sober lifestyle, it contradicts the idea of a family-wide ban based on Kris Jenner's alleged behavior at one event. This inconsistency adds to the suspicion of the claim's veracity.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the reliance on tabloid reporting, lack of corroborating sources, and internal inconsistencies, the message is more likely not a real representation of the events described.

Star magazine often publishes celebrity gossip that may not always be accurate or verified.\n\n2. **Nature of Claim**: The claim that the Kardashians were denied an invitation to an event due to unacceptable behavior seems plausible given their public image. However, specifics like Kris Jenner's \"sloppy behavior\" and the resulting ban on the entire family are not substantiated beyond anonymous insider claims.\n\n3. **Counterpoints**: While it's acknowledged that Kris Jenner enjoys vodka drinks, recent public statements from family members (like Khloe Kardashian's interview with Elle magazine) suggest that not all family members indulge heavily in alcohol. This contrasts with the narrative of a family-wide ban due to Kris Jenner's behavior.\n\n4. **Plausibility Check**: Events like the \"Night Before\" party are exclusive and invite-only, with attendees chosen carefully. While controversies can influence invitations, a blanket ban on an entire family based on one member's behavior seems extreme and unusual without further concrete evidence.\n\nConsidering these points, the claim lacks strong verifiable evidence beyond anonymous sources and sensational reporting. Therefore, I would return **0** as it is more likely to be an exaggerated or fabricated story rather than a true reflection of events.",

Hollywood's least serious award show is set to kick off the awards season, and while it may not hold the same weight as the Oscars, it often foreshadows the direction that the industry is heading in. Hosting the show this year is none other than Seth Meyers, who you may recognize from his NBC late-night show, \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\"\n\nThis will be Meyers' first time hosting the Golden Globes, but he's not exactly a stranger to talk show hosting. He'll be following in the footsteps of Jimmy Fallon, who hosted last year. NBC is marketing the show under the tagline \"Hollywood, we have a lot to talk about,\" so expect lots of humor and not-at-all uncomfortable and awkward moments about the recent turmoil in Hollywood over sexual harassment and abuse.\n\nMeyers spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about taking on the gig, revealing that he discussed it with his wife and women on his writing staff. He saw it as an opportunity to \"say some things that you wouldn't be able to say in previous years.\"\n\nOn the film side of things, The Shape of Water leads with seven nominations, followed closely by The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, both with six nods. Lady Bird is also up for several big awards, although not for Best Director, which once again overlooked all female directors.\n\nThe TV awards are more widely distributed, with HBO's Big Little Lies leading with six nominations, but it's up against a slate of other prominent prestige shows, including The Handmaid's Tale, This Is Us, Master of None, Stranger Things, and The Crown.\n\nThe ceremony will begin at 5PM PT / 8PM ET on Sunday, January 7th, and will take place at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The show will be broadcast live on NBC, as it has been since 1993. If you're in need of some extra glamour, you can tune in an hour earlier for the red carpet arrivals, which will be streamed exclusively on Facebook.\n\nSo how do you watch? If you have NBC, you can watch through an over-the-air antenna, cable, or satellite. If not, fear not! This year, NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have reached a deal to allow for online streaming of the awards show. Simply head to NBC's app or website, or check your cable or satellite provider for online access. And if you're not a subscriber, most of these services offer free seven-day trials, so you can give it a shot without committing to a long-term subscription.\n\nTwitter will also be a great resource for following along with reactions and memes in real time, and The Verge will be reporting live on the night, with a running list of winners, reactions, and other news. So gather around the TV, gather round the internet, and let's celebrate Hollywood's finest.",

Caitlyn, on the other hand, is reported to be angry with the Kardashians for not keeping their mouths shut about her transition, and has even suggested that they undergo polygraph tests to prove their claims. However, Gossip Cop has debunked these stories as untrue, and there has been no confirmation of Caitlyn attempting to set up a live TV special with her ex-wife and estranged daughters and stepdaughters.\n\nCaitlyn also spent Mother's Day alone, as her ex-wife Kris celebrated the holiday with their six children. Caitlyn, who was not mentioned in any of Kris's Instagram posts, was spotted alone on the morning of Mother's Day, dressed in pink and blue. Later that night, she was seen with a mystery blonde companion. On her show \"I am Cait,\" Caitlyn has discussed her past relationships and mentioned that she is open to a new romance with a man, but has not ruled out the possibility of dating women in the future.\n\nWhile some reports have suggested that Caitlyn may be de-transitioning back into a male due to negative reactions from her family, friends, and fans, it is important to note that only time will tell what Caitlyn's sexual orientation and gender identity will be.",

The young couple, who tied the knot just months ago, welcomed their little one into the world on Feb. 23, People Magazine reported exclusively.\n\nThe couple couldn't contain their excitement as they announced the arrival of their son, Gideon Martyn Forsyth, to the world. \"We are blessed beyond measure with the arrival of our son, Gideon Martyn Forsyth,\" they said. \"Looking at our child for the first time was such an incredible moment! God is so good, and we are so thankful.\"\n\nThe couple had been plagued by rumors of premarital sex for months, but fans of the Duggars came to their defense. One fan wrote on Google, \"Her due date is on Feb. 22, 2017, her conception date was on June 1st, 2017, and her wedding was on May 27, 2017. If anyone have [sic] doubt just check on Google reverse conception date.\" Another added, \"This would have happened most likely wedding night. May 26th. Like I said during the first week.\"\n\nBack in August, the couple announced they were expecting in a sweet Instagram post. \"Austin and I are SO thankful to announce that we are parents!! Even before we were married we prayed that God would give us children and we are so blessed that he has given us this baby! Jesus is the giver of Life! The baby has arms, legs, fingers, and toes. It has a beating heart and brain waves. The baby responds to touch and is already right- or left-handed. The baby has its own unique fingerprints, which are different from anyone else's. All organ systems are in place!\" They ended the post with a Bible verse.\n\nThe Duggars are back with their TLC show, Counting On, on Monday, Feb. 26.

It was here that she met her first husband, Topper Mortimer, and they began a love story that would take them to the pinnacle of society. Together, they moved to New York City, where Tinsley attended Columbia University and graduated with a degree in art history.\n\nAs soon as Tinsley landed in New York, her stunning blonde hair, her Southern charm, and her innate ability to build a personal brand propelled her into the spotlight. She quickly became the most photographed woman in the city, synonymous with the New York social scene. After working at Vogue, she transitioned to a career in public relations, always an entrepreneur at heart. She built a successful personal brand that was launched with a line of handbags, Samantha Thavasa by Tinsley Mortimer, a clothing collection, Riccimie by Tinsley Mortimer, which was sold exclusively in Japan, and a tabletop collection.\n\nTinsley then became the beauty ambassador for the iconic French fashion design house of Christian Dior and helped to create a lip gloss coined Tinsley Pink. She published her first novel, Southern Charm, and made her television debut in the hit TV show Gossip Girl in 2010. When she and Topper divorced, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City. A respite in Palm Beach gave her time to reflect on her accomplishments, and in late 2016, Tinsley decided to move back to New York City and prove that there is more to her than meets the eye.\n\nOnce back in the city she loves, she channeled her energy into her charity efforts, including supporting the Best Friends Animal Society. She is the celebrity ambassador for “No Dogs Left Behind,” a global animal rescue organization and flew to Beijing on behalf of the charity last year. Tinsley brought five rescues back to the states with her and adopted two from the group, naming them Strawberry & Shortcake.\n\nIn 2018, Tinsley teamed up with the cosmetic brand Winky Lux, to create her own collection titled XXO Tinsley for Winky Lux. She launched with a range of eyelashes in three different sizes, a giftset titled a Wink & Kiss, and created her favorite shade of lip gloss, appropriately titled Vodka Cran.\n\nNow that Tinsley is finally back and settled into her New York groove, she is ready to open herself up to finding the perfect match with whom she can continue to build her empire and share her special love for animals.",

Kelly has released a new 19-minute song, \"I Admit,\" addressing the sexual abuse claims against him and revealing the personal troubles that have plagued him throughout his career.\n\nThe track, which was posted to Soundcloud on Monday, begins with the lyrics, \"I admit I have made some mistakes/And I have some imperfect ways.\" Kelly then gets personal, singing that he likes \"all the ladies, that's both older and young ladies,\" followed by the statement, \"But tell me how they call it pedophile because that (expletive) is crazy.\"\n\nThe embattled entertainer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has long been accused of behavior that has ranged from questionable to criminal. He was accused of child pornography after a widely circulated videotape appeared to show him having sex with, and urinating on, a teenage girl. He was acquitted of all charges in 2008 and continued to rack up hits and sell out stadiums around the country.\n\nOn \"I Admit,\" Kelly sings that he's \"not convicted, not arrested, dragged my name in the dirt/All this work to be successful, when you abandon me 'cause of what you heard.\" The song also reveals that he was sexually abused as a child, with the lyrics, \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nKelly is one of pop music's best-selling artists and his hits include \"Ignition,\" ''I Believe I Can Fly,\" ''Step in the Name of Love\" and \"Bump N' Grind.\" He has also written hits for artists ranging from Celine Dion to Michael Jackson to Lady Gaga. While he's written classic love songs and even gospel music, he is defined by sexually explicit songs such as \"Feelin' on Yo Booty,\" ''Your Body's Calling Me,\" ''Sex Me\" and even more explicit fare.\n\nOn the new song, he says he was sexually abused as a child, singing \"a family member touched me\" and revealing he was \"so scared to say something, so I just put the blame on me.\"\n\nThe song has sparked outrage on social media, with celebrities and activists condemning Kelly and calling for his arrest. Rapper Talib Kweli Greene said in a Twitter post, \"His lack of self-awareness is atrocious. There are several lyrics I take offense to. The one I will address is 'I’m just a man.' I am also a man. I would never use that to defend this behavior.\"\n\nIn conjunction to the #MeToo movement, Viola Davis, Shonda Rhimes and Ava DuVernay and other celebrities participated in the Time's Up movement's #MuteRKelly social media campaign in April, calling for a boycott of his music and performances.\n\nKelly's concert in his hometown of Chicago was canceled around the time the Times' Up campaign took aim at the singer over allegations he sexually abused women. Weeks later, Spotify removed his music from its playlists, citing its new policy on hate content and hateful conduct.\n\nThe song was not released on Sony's RCA Records, where Kelly is signed. The label said it had no comment about the song. Kelly posted a link to the song Monday with the caption: \"Today is the day you've been waiting for.\"\n\nIn May, a woman filed a lawsuit against Kelly, accusing the singer of sexual battery, knowingly infecting her with herpes and locking her in rooms for punishment.\n\nKelly's new track is a bold move, but it's unclear if it will be enough to save his career, which has been put on hold due to the sexual abuse claims. The #MeToo movement has exposed the dark side of the entertainment industry and Kelly's admission may not be enough to repair the damage to his reputation.\n\nKelly's fans will have to decide if they can forgive him for his past mistakes and support him moving forward. Only time will tell if Kelly's admission will be enough to save his career and repair the damage to his reputation.",

No one controls her. She makes all her own decisions. No matter how hard you try to advise.

Gomez has not commented on her decision to join the movie directed by Allen, which does not have a premiere date. At least three stars of the movie, Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Hall, and Griffin Newman, have vowed to donate their income from the movie to different charities supporting women and the Time's Up movement.\n\nMeanwhile, actor Alec Baldwin has come out in support of Allen, tweeting that he was investigated forensically by two states and no charges were filed.

Get the Scoop on His Lavish Lifestyle and Divorce Settlement with Kelly Clarkson!\"\n\nIf you've been following the latest celeb gossip, then you've probably heard of Brandon Blackstock. This American talent manager has a net worth of a staggering $10 million, making him one of the richest people in the business. But how did he get so rich? And what's his life like? In this exclusive article, we'll reveal all the details on Brandon's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about Brandon's net worth. As a talent manager, he's worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Kelly Clarkson. And it seems that his hard work has paid off big time. In 2023, Brandon was awarded a whopping $10 million net worth, making him one of the wealthiest people in the business.\n\nBut how did he get so rich? Well, Brandon has been in the music industry for over a decade, starting out as a talent agent for his stepmother, Reba McEntire. He later formed his own talent management company, Starstruck Entertainment, which manages the careers of many successful musicians and actors.\n\nBut Brandon's success didn't stop there. In 2013, he married Kelly Clarkson, the stunning singer and winner of American Idol. Together, they have two children and a luxurious lifestyle. In 2018, they lived in an $8 million mansion in Encino, California, before Kelly bought a $10 million mansion in the same neighborhood.\n\nBut things didn't go as smoothly as planned in their marriage. In 2020, Kelly filed for divorce from Brandon, citing irreconcilable differences. But before things could get too far, Brandon filed for spousal and child support, asking for $436,000 per month. A judge eventually ordered Kelly to pay him $45,000 per month in child support and $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years. She also had to pay him $1.2 million to cover his legal expenses.\n\nBut things got even more complicated when Kelly claimed that Brandon had defrauded her during his 13 years as her manager. She accused him of overcharging her millions of dollars and not being licensed to operate as a talent agent. Brandon's company, Starstruck Management Group, countered by pointing out that Kelly was always properly represented by her separate talent agency, CAA.\n\nIn the end, an LA judge sided with Kelly, ruling that Brandon had indeed overcharged her. But despite this setback, Brandon still walks away with a net worth of $10 million, proving that he's one of the most successful talent managers in the business.\n\nSo there you have it, folks. The inside scoop on Brandon Blackstock's net worth, his divorce from Kelly Clarkson, and his luxurious real estate. From his days as a talent agent to his current net worth of $10 million, Brandon Blackstock has come a long way. And with his stunning wife and two beautiful children, he seems to have it all.",

The 26-year-old reality TV star took to her Instagram Story on Tuesday morning to dispel the rumors, admitting that she and her husband don’t always see eye-to-eye on things.\n\nBut Evans quickly clarified that this “doesn’t mean” they are separating. She wrote alongside an eyeroll emoji: “Lmfao Married couples have disagreements but that doesn’t mean they are ‘splitting up.’ #RUMORS.”\n\nThe post comes days after Radar reported that Evans unfollowed Eason on Instagram and that the couple aren’t Facebook friends. But Evans’ latest post seems to suggest that everything is fine between them.\n\nIn a video posted hours after dispelling the breakup rumors, Evans was seen embracing Eason and their two children while looking for a Christmas tree. The caption read: “In the pines, trying to find a #ChristmasTree.”\n\nBut Evans’ posts come nearly two months after she placed a 911 call about Eason, alleging that he assaulted her. People confirmed that Evans was hospitalized after the incident.\n\nIn a statement to E! News, Evans said her 911 call was “a drunk and dramatic misunderstanding.” “Everything is great. … We are totally fine,” she said.\n\nThe couple shares daughter Ensley Jolie, almost 2. Evans is also mom to 8-year-old son Jace and 4-year-old son Kaiser, from previous relationships.",

After months of speculation, Jenner released a 10-minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her child. The announcement comes after months of speculation and a Calvin Klein campaign by all the Kardashian sisters that convinced fans that Jenner was expecting a child.\n\nFollowing the announcement that Khloe Kardashian is pregnant with her first baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, fans have been calling on Jenner to confirm the news. Some fans were frustrated that she didn't confirm it in a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, when Kardashian told her she was pregnant. Jenner and her boyfriend Travis Scott have been spotted looking loved up and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, indicating that they are still together.\n\nFans have been speculating about Jenner's pregnancy for months, with some pointing to an old social media video from the Golden Globes where they claim to see a baby bump. Photos taken \"months ago\" from her friend's birthday party also show Jenner in an oversized jumper, concealing her figure. The absence of Jenner from social media led to rumors that she had split from Scott, but a recent video put these rumors to rest.\n\nAfter 24 days of snippets from the famous Kardashian Christmas card, fans were convinced day 25, Christmas Day, would be the big reveal. However, Jenner was nowhere to be seen at all, leaving fans sure that she was heavily pregnant. Fans were still convinced a baby announcement was on the way after spotting a \"clue\" in one of the Kardashian Christmas calendar photos.\n\nDuring the upcoming Christmas special of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris Jenner revealed what she was most thankful for – and got very emotional. \"I used to pray that one of you guys would have a baby and now it’s like a faucet that we turned on that won’t turn off,\" she confessed. \"The fact that I have all these grandchildren...\" Fans couldn't help but make the connection following Jenner's pregnancy reports.\n\nIn pictures obtained by The Sun, a marquee lined with pink curtains can be seen set up at the back of Jenner's LA mansion, showing pink decorations filling the garden. Pink objects appear to be floating in the pool, while matching cushions adorn the seating area. Jenner appeared in pink silk pyjamas, suggesting the baby shower was for herself and she is expecting a baby girl.\n\nFans are convinced they know when Scott found out the \"happy news\" from Jenner, who has a huge net worth. On June 12, the star cryptically tweeted: \"Legit the happiest day of my life.\" According to Perez Hilton, this would coincide perfectly with the reported due date, and the pair went on to get a matching butterfly tattoo.\n\nPeople magazine originally reported that Jenner was due to give birth in February 2018. A source said: \"They started telling friends a few weeks ago. The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis!\" Another insider added: \"It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about. Everyone is overjoyed for her. This is the happiest she’s ever been.\"\n\nJenner has not confirmed or denied her pregnancy, but reports have already begun speculating about what she would name her future child. An alleged insider told Hollywood Life: \"She would like to do something both unique and keep the 'K' first name consistent with her sisters and mum.\" Fans thought she may have gone with the name Butterfly given that she and Scott both have matching small butterfly tattoos on their ankles. Jenner told Elle UK in December 2015 that she would delete her account as soon as she has a child. \"Once I have a kid, I’m not going to be on Instagram,\" she said. “You know, I’ll probably delete my Instagram and just... I don’t know, live life.”",

According to CNN, the cause of death has not yet been determined, but \"at this stage, nothing suggests the intervention of a third party.\"\n\nArgento and Bourdain met in 2016 when they collaborated on an episode of Parts Unknown in Rome. She became heavily involved in his creative process and directed an upcoming episode set in Hong Kong. Bourdain often consulted her for her vast knowledge of music and film, and he spoke openly about how much he cherished her presence in his life.\n\nIn a heart-wrenching statement, Argento said, \"Anthony gave all of himself in everything that he did. His brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds. He was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated. My thoughts are with his family.

It cites HollywoodLife.com as the source of information regarding Pattinson's reactions to Stewart's jokes during her opening monologue.\n\nTo assess the veracity of this message, we should consider several factors:\n\n1. **Source Reliability**: HollywoodLife.com is known for celebrity news and gossip. While it covers entertainment extensively, its credibility can be questionable due to its focus on sensationalism rather than strict journalistic standards.\n\n2. **Plausibility**: It's plausible that Kristen Stewart would host SNL and use humor related to her past relationship with Robert Pattinson, given the show's tradition of addressing current events and personal stories of hosts.\n\n3. **Public Knowledge**: Events like SNL hosting and celebrity reactions are often reported widely across various entertainment news outlets. If this event occurred as described, it's likely other sources would corroborate or refute the details.\n\n4. **Behavior of Parties Involved**: Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have been public figures with a documented history, making it conceivable that Pattinson might attend or watch her SNL appearance and react positively to her performance.\n\nConsidering these points, while the specifics of Robert Pattinson's reaction are based on a single source (HollywoodLife.com) known for celebrity gossip, the overall scenario described aligns with what could reasonably happen in the realm of celebrity and entertainment news. Therefore, I would lean towards assessing the message as more likely to be real, albeit with some caution due to the single sourcing.\n\n**Verdict: 1**\n\nThis assessment is based on the plausible nature of the event described and the typical coverage patterns of entertainment news outlets.",

The shoot is said to be a significant moment in Jenner's life, as she completed gender reassignment surgery in January and announced her transition in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer in April 2015. The photo shoot is said to be Jenner's \"fine hour\" since her transition.\n\nAlthough the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be supportive of Jenner's transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is \"their worst nightmare.\" A source told DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of Jenner's plan from her model son Brody and were shocked by the idea.\n\n\"Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said. 'They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'\n\nKris, the Kardashian matriarch, is said to be determined to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the source. \"She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,' said the source. 'But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'\n\nJenner's memoir, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has been a source of tension between her and her family. A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nJenner's family is said to feel that she has been milking her fame and riding on their coattails for too long. They feel that if she wants to do things her way, she should be on her own. While the operation was inevitable, they think her plan to do a nude spread is over the top and something that is really annoying to them.",

Selena's tragic death in 1995 led to increased popularity of her music, including \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,\" which has indeed been covered by various artists, including Jennifer Lopez.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears to be describing known and verifiable facts about Selena, her songwriting process, and the cultural impact of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.\" Therefore, the veracity assessment leans towards it being a real message.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nVeracity assessment: 1",
        "cs_rationale": "Based on the information provided in the message, there are several points that can be considered to assess its veracity.\n\nFirstly, it claims that Selena wrote the song \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" and revealed its meaning in an interview with Don Francisco on Sábado Gigante in 1994. This claim could potentially be verified through historical records, interviews, or documented sources from that time period. Selena was indeed known for her songwriting abilities, so it is plausible that she could have written the song.\n\nSecondly, the message mentions that Selena described \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" as the sound of the heart when it sees a man pass by, and she wrote it after Chris Pérez joined Los Dinos. This detail aligns with known facts about Selena's personal and professional life, including her relationship with Chris Pérez, which lends credibility to this part of the story.\n\nThirdly, it states that \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" gained increased popularity after Selena's death and has been covered by Jennifer Lopez and Kat Von D. This claim can be verified through the existence of these covers and the song's continued cultural significance, which is well-documented.\n\nConsidering these points, the message appears to be consistent with known facts about Selena's career and the cultural impact of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.\" Therefore, based on the information provided and the likelihood that the claims can be substantiated, I would predict its veracity as 1.",

It then provides an example involving Justin Bieber and his tattoos related to his mother and Selena Gomez.\n\nTo evaluate the veracity, several points can be considered:\n\n1. **Content Analysis**: The message discusses two main topics: difficulties of post-breakup item retrieval and the sensitivity of explaining tattoos to ex-partners. These are plausible scenarios in personal relationships, although the specifics of Justin Bieber's tattoos would require fact-checking for accuracy.\n\n2. **Language and Context**: The message is coherent and uses culturally relevant examples (Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez) to illustrate its points. This enhances its credibility since it connects to known public figures and common relationship dynamics.\n\n3. **Plausibility Check**: The scenarios described align with common experiences in relationships, where emotional and practical challenges like post-breakup property division and discussing shared memories (like tattoos) can indeed be complex.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Relevance**: Discussions about celebrities and their personal lives are frequent in media, making the reference to Justin Bieber and his tattoos plausible in the context of a broader cultural narrative.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears more likely to be based on real-life scenarios rather than fabricated content. It integrates personal relationship challenges with a celebrity example to illustrate its points, which resonates with common experiences and cultural references.

Despite never working with Weinstein, Hanks expressed his disgust and shock at the allegations.\n\nWhen asked why Hollywood “sheltered” Weinstein despite rumors of his inappropriate behavior, Hanks rejected the excuse that his behavior could be considered old-fashioned. He asked, “Well, that’s a really good question and isn’t it part and parcel to all of society somehow, that people in power get away with this?”\n\nHanks emphasized that power in Hollywood can be rather manipulative. “I think it’s like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can,” the actor said.\n\n“They think their achievements entitle them,” Hanks said, proceeding to reference a quote about power. “Somebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: ‘When you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are,'” Hanks said.\n\nHanks agrees with the quote, saying he supports the negative backlash against the movie mogul. “I would say, there’s an example of how that’s true. Just because you’re rich and famous and powerful doesn’t mean you aren’t in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away ‘fat,'” Hanks said. “But I’m not, you know, I’m not the first person to say Harvey’s a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey — I’m not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus.

It mentions that both actors initially had reservations about the unconventional production style but were convinced by the director to participate. Debra Messing supposedly explained her decision to accept the role in an interview with EurWeb, emphasizing her instinct-driven approach to choosing roles. The message concludes by stating that the film is currently in theaters.\n\nTo assess the veracity of this message, we can consider several factors:\n\n1. **Film Existence and Premise**: It's plausible that a film titled \"Searching\" exists, as such films have been produced before (e.g., the 2018 thriller \"Searching\" starring John Cho). The description of the film's unique production style aligns with what was innovative about the actual film.\n\n2. **Involvement of Debra Messing and John Cho**: While John Cho did star in the actual film \"Searching,\" there is no confirmation in the provided text about Debra Messing's involvement. This raises a potential discrepancy.\n\n3. **Statement by Debra Messing**: Without further verification from the EurWeb interview or other reliable sources, the claim about Debra Messing's rationale for accepting the role remains unverified.\n\n4. **Current Status of the Film**: The assertion that the film is now playing in theaters would need verification from current sources to confirm its accuracy at the time of assessment.\n\nConsidering these points, the message contains a mix of verifiable details (such as the film's premise and production style) and potentially unverified claims (specifically regarding Debra Messing's involvement and statements).

The couple, who share Irish heritage, have kept their relationship under wraps so far that virtually nothing is known about McGill.\n\nSo who is this mysterious man who has captured Balfe's heart? The couple got engaged over the holidays, and Balfe couldn't contain her excitement when talking about it. \"I’m very happy,\" she said.\n\nDespite the lack of information about McGill, there are some clues that suggest he's the one for Balfe. A throwback video of the pair from 2015 shows McGill looking smitten with his future bride. And while they've only been spotted together publicly twice, they've managed to keep their relationship out of the spotlight.\n\nBalfe and McGill were first seen together at the 2016 ceremony for Jodie Foster's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and they were also at the 2017 Oscar Wilde Awards.

With over 435 episodes, Grey's Anatomy has surpassed even The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, which ran for 15 seasons and 435 episodes. Only seven dramas in the history of television have had more seasons than Grey's, including Gunsmoke, Law & Order, NCIS, CSI, and ER.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made official at the wrap party for the Shonda Rhimes drama, where ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey praised the show's loyal fans and the new generations of viewers who continue to discover the joy and drama of Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\nThe renewal of Grey's Anatomy was made possible thanks to a new two-year deal signed by star Ellen Pompeo, who remains the highest-earning actress on a drama series. The deal includes a seven-figure signing bonus, two full backend equity points on the show, and producing fees on both the flagship series and spinoff Station 19.\n\nGrey's Anatomy has become increasingly important for ABC since creator Shonda Rhimes left her longtime home at ABC Studios for a nine-figure deal with Netflix.

Additionally, the context of Witherspoon being an executive producer and Streep joining the cast for season 2 adds credibility to the dynamics described.

Streep's prestigious background is mentioned, adding context to the conflict. Furthermore, it notes the imminent premiere of the second season in 2019.\n\nTo assess the veracity of this message, several factors come into play. Firstly, disputes and tensions on sets of popular TV shows are not uncommon, especially when high-profile actors like Witherspoon and Streep are involved. Such conflicts can arise due to various reasons such as creative differences, competitive dynamics, or personal interactions. Witherspoon's dual role as an actor and executive producer could feasibly contribute to power struggles and perceptions of dominance. Streep's acclaimed career and awards add credibility to the context of the conflict, as her presence might alter dynamics on set.\n\nSecondly, the specifics provided about the show's upcoming season premiere in 2019 align with factual timelines known from public sources. This adds authenticity to the claim's temporal context.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the plausibility of tensions between prominent actors on a high-profile show, the specifics provided, and the alignment with known facts, the message appears more likely to be real than fabricated.\n\nTherefore, I predict its veracity as 1.",

The mention of a Moscow gynecologist advising against following the Duchess's quick departure from the maternity hospital further adds to the narrative.\n\nTo assess the veracity of this message, we can consider several points:\n1. **Plausibility of Conspiracy Theories**: It's not uncommon for conspiracy theories to circulate around high-profile events like royal births. However, the specifics mentioned (surrogate mother, doubts about the birth itself) seem sensational and lack credible evidence.\n\n2. **Media Reporting**: The message mentions that it has been reported that these theories are circulating in Russia. Without specific sources or verifiable reports, it's challenging to confirm the accuracy of these claims.\n\n3. **Commonsense Evaluation**: While conspiracy theories can arise, the claims made (such as the involvement of a surrogate mother and doubts about the birth) typically require substantial evidence to be taken seriously. In the absence of such evidence, these claims lean towards being speculative rather than factual.\n\nGiven these points, the message appears to describe a situation where conspiracy theories are being discussed rather than presenting verified facts.

Despite this, FX supported the brothers, who have overall deals at FX Prods.\n\nThe untitled Marvel's Deadpool series was to be produced by Marvel TV in association with FX Productions and ABC Signature Studios. It is unclear whether Marvel TV and ABC Studios will continue to pursue the project.

There doesn't seem to be any romantic tension between Valkyrie and Thor, which is fine.\n\nLoki was the butt of jokes and seemed to lack his usual depth. He wasn't entirely in line with his previous characterization, and I question his relevance to the story. If Marvel doesn't give him a clear purpose beyond satisfying fans, his contract may not be renewed. I wouldn't be surprised if he's 'killed' off in Infinity War and then brought back to life in Avengers 4, perhaps as Kid Loki or Agent of Asgard Loki as Marvel introduces new Avengers members and seeks to reboot the franchise.\n\nI enjoyed the dynamic between Bruce and Thor, and I don't like the forced inclusion of the Black Widow scene. I would prefer to see more scenes featuring Valkyrie and Bruce. The events of the movie left me feeling like I was watching a fan fiction or side story. While it may be entertaining, it doesn't align with the tone I would like to see in future sequels. Despite the positive reception from critics and fans, I'm in the minority on this opinion.\"",

But she is a big believer in falling in love and spending her life with a partner that loves sharing hers.\"\n\nThe source also revealed that Aniston and Theroux's clashing lifestyles were a major factor in their decision to end their relationship.

The source said, \"They wanted to start a family early in their relationship, but it didn't work out.

During this time, actress Ana Gasteyer filled in for Ripa and stood by as Strahan made the announcement. Reports of behind-the-scenes drama began to surface, and many are curious about what exactly happened.\n\nThere have been rumors about a rift between Strahan and Ripa, with sources claiming that they have not been getting along recently. Strahan has been a contributing correspondent on Good Morning America for approximately two years, and Ripa felt blindsided by the news of his departure. According to a source close to Ripa, she said in a meeting, \"Didn't I tell you this was going to happen? . . . I told you two years ago this was going to happen.\"\n\nRipa's absence after the news broke seemed partially planned and partially not. ABC and her publicist claimed that the absence was tied to a preplanned vacation, but Kelly's vacation was not previously mentioned. Ripa dropped a subtle message after the news broke, carrying a copy of a book called David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants. It is speculated that this may be a coincidence.\n\nRipa has also initiated complete radio silence with Strahan, reportedly not acknowledging him and refusing to discuss any plans with ABC executives. Strahan's final show has been set for May 13, and he will leave the show in May instead of staying through the summer. Ripa spoke out about Strahan's exit in People, saying that she can understand why he might have made an \"oversight\" not to inform her of his departure. She also said that they are like a family, and sometimes \"when you are so comfortable with somebody, you may not give them the same consideration as somebody you're not as comfortable with—a certain formality falls away.\"",

These details provide a concrete backdrop to the narrative.\n\n2. **Plausibility**: The context of Kerr seeking refuge from celebrity scrutiny aligns with known celebrity behaviors of seeking privacy in remote locations. The mention of feeling isolated due to Wellington's physical isolation also fits the geographical reality of New Zealand.\n\n3. **Realistic Scenarios**: Kerr's interactions with a production assistant and experiencing the natural beauty and hospitality of New Zealand are plausible scenarios for someone in her position.\n\n4. **Lack of Outlandish Claims**: The message does not contain exaggerated or sensational claims that would raise doubts about its authenticity. It portrays Kerr's experience in a relatable and believable manner.\n\nConsidering these factors, the message appears more likely to be a real account rather than fabricated.

The British actor Michael Sheen and the comedian Sarah Silverman, known for their shared anti-populist views, have called it quits after four years of being in a relationship. According to Sheen, their passion for politics was what ultimately led to their separation.\n\nSheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the '30s, told the Daily Telegraph that the Brexit referendum was what inspired him to become more politically active. However, their desire to make a difference in the world led them to take different paths. Silverman, an American, wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, while Sheen, a Welshman, wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.\n\n\"We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions—because she is American and I’m Welsh,\" Sheen explained. \"After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.\"\n\nDespite the difficult decision to part ways, both Sheen and Silverman acknowledge that each of them had to do what they needed to do. Sheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales, aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.\n\nAs the Telegraph puts it, \"Sheen sounds a little wistful\" about the impact that politics had on his love life.

He stated that becoming a parent had never been part of his DNA and that they didn't plan on it.\n\nClooney and Amal became pregnant in 2016, and he was with her in London when they went to the doctor for an ultrasound. When the doctor told them there were two fetuses, Clooney was surprised and kept thinking there was a mistake. The couple welcomed Alexander and Ella on June 6, a month premature, at St. Mary's Hospital, where Prince William and Kate Middleton's children were born. Alexander was born one minute and 49 seconds before Ella, and Clooney revealed that Alexander weighed five and a half pounds, while Ella weighed four and a half pounds. The twins have dual British and American nationality.\n\nClooney, who is 56, described his reaction to the birth as \"wild.\" He added that becoming a parent was a sudden realization, and he wanted his children to be happy, have a sense of humor, and be interested in things.\n\nWhile Clooney admitted that both parents are \"unrested\" in their new role, he was surprised to find that he was good at changing diapers. He also denied that the couple used fertility drugs to become pregnant, despite speculation that this may have arisen due to Amal's age and the multiple births.\n\nIn other news, Clooney is promoting his new film, Suburbicon, a drama set in the late 1950s that he directed and co-wrote with Grant Heslov, starring Matt Damon and Julianne Moore.

The couple's on-again, off-again relationship has been the subject of tabloid headlines and social media chatter, but the details of what caused the latest breakup remain unclear.\n\nINSIDER spoke with relationship experts to get to the bottom of why getting back together with an ex is almost always a bad idea. According to April Masini, a relationship expert and online advice forum host, the couple's pattern of breaking up and getting back together is a bad behavioral pattern that can become a source of strain in their daily lives. \"Drama replaces problem solving and breakups become a very disruptive part of the relationship dynamic,\" Masini said.\n\nSusan Winter, another relationship expert and best-selling author, added that reuniting with an ex is typically not worthwhile unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted. \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" Winter said. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.\"\n\nRachel DeAlto, another relationship expert, agreed that getting back together with an ex is often more trouble than it's worth. \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" DeAlto said. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.\"\n\nDespite these experts' advice, it's possible that Evans and Slate may be following the same line of thinking that has led to their previous breakups. \"They're a great odd couple, and Hollywood loves an odd couple romance,\" Masini said. \"And they're not insusceptible to what fans love to see, which makes their issues even tougher.\"\n\nThe good news is that breakups can often lead to positive change. \"A breakup can be an enormous motivator to improve ourselves,\" Winter said. \"The clients that come to me and tell me they've lost somebody they love are so incredibly motivated to correct and change things about themselves and their personality.\"\n\nWhether Evans and Slate will heed this advice remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: getting back together with an ex is rarely the solution to relationship problems.",

From the dress that divided the world to the \"hot felon\" who became a global sensation, these are the moments that broke the internet in a way that no other could.\n\nThe dress that divided the world\n\nOn February 26, 2015, a tweet featuring a close-up photo of a dress went viral, sparking a heated debate about its color. The dress was actually a blue and black bandage dress from British retailer Roman Originals, but people saw it as gold and white or blue and black. The debate raged on for days, with 7.6 million tweets and a surge in traffic to Roman Originals' site. The retailer sold out of the original black and gold dress in 34 minutes and eventually sold a white and gold version in support of British charity Comic Relief.\n\nApril the Giraffe's birth\n\nIn the spring of 2017, all eyes were on April, a pregnant giraffe at Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York. The live-streaming camera set up in April's habitat captivated viewers as she gave birth to calf Tajiri on April 15, 2017. The live stream garnered more than 232 million live views on YouTube over a seven-week period.\n\nThe \"yanny\" or \"laurel\" debate\n\nIn May 2018, a bizarre recording of the word \"laurel\" split the internet in two. While some heard the word \"laurel,\" others clearly heard \"yanny,\" and nobody could agree on who was right. The audio clip was from an online dictionary entry, and the differing interpretations of the clip all had to do with how the brain interprets sound frequencies.\n\nJeremy Meeks, the \"hot felon\"\n\nIn June 2014, the Stockton Police Department released a mugshot of Jeremy Meeks, a 30-year-old inmate arrested on a weapons charge. Meeks' chiseled jaw and piercing eyes quickly made him a global sensation, and he was dubbed the \"hot felon.\" Meeks signed to a modeling agency and has since worked around the world.\n\nBeyoncé's pregnancy announcement\n\nWhen Beyoncé makes an announcement, the world stops to listen, and her early morning pregnancy announcement was no different. Pregnant with twins, Queen Beyoncé posted a photo to Instagram in the wee hours of February 1, 2017, announcing that the Carter-Knowles family was \"blessed two times over\" and would be growing their family by two. The announcement post earned more than 11 million likes, making it one of the most-liked Instagram posts of all time.\n\nTrump's \"covfefe\" tweet\n\nOn May 31, 2017, President Trump tweeted, \"Despite the constant negative press covfefe.\" A screenshot of the now-deleted tweet shows Trump's use of \"covfefe\" in an apparent typo. The word became a catchphrase of sorts that spawned T-shirts, hashtags, and even a license plate. The baffling term even lent its name to a legislative proposal from U.S. Rep Mike Quigley. If enacted, the COVFEFE Act (Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act) would have required the National Archives to keep records of the president's tweets.\n\nKim Kardashian's Paper magazine cover\n\nIn 2017, Kim Kardashian's bare-all cover of Paper magazine brought the phrase \"break the internet\" into the public lexicon. The magazine unveiled two covers shot by Jean-Paul Goude that feature the reality star, including one where she bares all.

With estimated net worths of over $100 million, it's hard to imagine the amount of hard work and dedication that has gone into his success.\n\nBut what exactly does Wade make his money from? The answer is simple: basketball and massive paychecks. Since joining the NBA in 2003-2004, Wade has made over $136 million playing the game he loves. His current contract pays him $15 million this season, with another $16.1 million due next season if he opts-in to his player option.\n\nBut Wade's success doesn't stop there. Along with LeBron James, Wade has mastered the art of taking short-term contracts to increase his flexibility and secure larger annual contracts. In 2014, he signed a two-year, $31.1 million contract with a player option, setting him up to be a free agent when the salary cap increases in 2016-2017. And when that time comes, Wade will be set to cash in on the biggest paydays of his career.\n\nHowever, even with all of his accomplishments, Wade was only the 21st highest-paid player in the NBA last year, according to ESPN. He made far less than players like Joe Johnson, Rudy Gay, and Brook Lopez. But that's not reason to feel bad for Wade, though. He's made tens of millions more in sponsorship deals, including a high-profile deal with a sports brand in China.\n\nOver the years, Wade has had sponsorship deals with Converse and Nike, but his biggest deal was with Chinese shoe company Li Ning. In 2012, he signed a 10-year deal with the company that few consumers know in the U.S., but which will pay him millions annually along with a reported $60 million stake in the company. It was a high-risk move for both Li Ning and Wade, and it's uncertain if it's paying off. Li Ning just reported its third straight year of losses, and its stock has gone almost nowhere since Wade signed the deal.\n\nOn top of Li Ning, Wade has had slightly less lucrative deals with Gatorade, Pepperidge Farm, Mission, and other brands. In total, Forbes estimates that he made $12 million in sponsorships last year.\n\nAdd it all up, and Dwyane Wade has made well over $200 million in his career. But after paying agents, managers, and living expenses, his net worth is likely significantly less than that. Estimates of his net worth are between $95 million and $115 million, and he has millions more coming in future years.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, Dwyane Wade has built a huge net worth and he'll likely add to it in years to come.

Upon arrival, I discovered that the parlor floor, despite the unseasonable heat outside, was warmed by a roaring fire. As I waited, I realized that I was sitting in Harvey Weinstein's living room. He had purchased the six-story house in 2006, before marrying Chapman, and she had since transformed it with her style. The black floors and white rugs, chinoiserie, gilt, and glass, hydrangeas in a vase, and a Jo Malone candle completed the ambiance.\n\nA few weeks earlier, I had met Chapman at the Marchesa fashion company atelier, where she co-owns the business with Keren Craig. She appeared nervous and uncomfortable, mentioning that she had not been out in public for five months since similar accusations against her husband were made public. Today, she was more relaxed, though there was a sense of gallows humor. When I mentioned the warm weather, she quipped, \"Think of all the poor plants that are going to spring out and then die.\"\n\nWe moved downstairs to the ground floor, which was a large, open space with modern furniture and surprising art. There was a spacious kitchen that overlooked the backyard, and a TV room where Chapman's son Dash was sitting on a sectional encircled by some kind of electronic device. At 42, Chapman looked younger than in photographs, perhaps because she was more goofy than I had imagined. Although she retained her British accent, she was more laid-back than I had expected.\n\nOur meeting took place in Chapman's soon-to-be-ex-townhouse that had recently been sold by her soon-to-be-ex-husband. It was meant to be the first time she publicly addressed what happened with her husband. However, the night before our meeting, she called me late and sounded worried, apologetic, and unsure of whether she was ready to address difficult questions. I reassured her that we could discuss topics unrelated to her marriage to Weinstein. During our meeting, we primarily discussed her life before her marriage to Weinstein and her fashion company Marchesa.",

At the time, he was mostly known for his production work and had not yet gained widespread recognition as a rapper. However, this accident would ultimately inspire one of his most successful songs, \"Through the Wire.\"\n\nAccording to West himself, he was working late at night in the studio with Beanie Sigel, Peedi Crack, and The Black Eyed Peas when he was cut off by another vehicle and collided with a car just blocks away from the W Hotel. The accident left him with a broken jaw and required reconstructive surgery.\n\nDespite having no health insurance, West paid for all of his medical expenses out of pocket. He spent several weeks in the hospital and was unable to work or produce music during this time.\n\nAfter his release from the hospital, West returned to the studio and created \"Through the Wire,\" a song he rapped with a broken jaw. The song was eventually released on his debut mixtape, Get Well Soon, in early 2003.\n\nDespite not receiving much label support at the time, West's \"Through the Wire\" eventually became a hit and helped propel him to stardom. The song was the first single off of his classic debut album, College Dropout, which was released on February 10, 2004. Since then, Kanye West has become one of the most successful and influential rappers of his generation.",

Despite the challenges, Ragland represented her daughter and the two of them have a close relationship.\n\nRoyal expert Alastair Bruce explained that it is very much a matter for the bride and groom to decide who gets invited and where they sit at the wedding. The couple enlists the help of The Lord Chamberlain's Office when making these decisions and knows the layout of St. George’s Chapel.\n\nAs the ceremony unfolded, Ragland's strength and grace inspired many, and she was praised for her ability to sit through the pressure and scrutiny of the event. Her attendance at the wedding was a testament to the love and support she has for her daughter and the new royal family.",

This comes after the couple went public with their relationship, which had reportedly been ongoing for two years.\n\nThe insider told OK! Magazine that Holmes has adjusted her workout routine and is avoiding alcohol. They have also started talking with friends about their future as a family. While they have not confirmed a pregnancy, they have not denied it either. The couple is said to be thrilled that their relationship is now out in the open and no longer needs to be kept secret.\n\nKatie has a 11-year-old daughter, Suri Cruise, from her previous marriage to Tom Cruise. Jamie has two daughters from previous relationships: Corinne, 23, and Annalise, 8. Having a new half-sibling for the girls would make their family even bigger and happier.\n\nAs of now, it is unclear when the couple will announce their alleged pregnancy. However, paparazzi have spotted the couple walking on the beach in Los Angeles, and Holmes was wearing an uncharacteristically large, flowy dress. While it could be that she is simply being comfortable for a casual outing, some are speculating that she might be hiding a baby bump.\n\nKatie and Jamie have been having a great time together, and sources tell HollywoodLife.com that Holmes feels happier with Jamie than she ever did when she was married to Tom. Jamie's sense of humor is something that Holmes admires, and sources say that he could become a wonderful father figure to Suri, who reportedly has not seen her own father in four years.\n\nIt is not clear if the couple is planning to get married or have a baby. HollywoodLife.com has reached out to both Katie and Jamie's reps for comment.",

Not only did she crash the stage not once, but twice, leaving attendees in a state of confusion and embarrassment.\n\nAs Armie Hammer was presenting the night's penultimate honor, Fergie walked onstage, interrupting the actor's speech and leaving him in a state of panic. Armie whispered something to Fergie before she began her horribly awkward speech, which left everyone wondering what was going on.\n\nFergie then pretended to be Armie Hammer and continued his speech, praising Tom Ford and promoting his new song. She even sang a few lines from her song \"A Little Work,\" leaving everyone in attendance in awe.\n\nBut things took a turn for the worse when Fergie suddenly jumped up from her seat and crashed the show for a second time, leading the audience in a sing-along of her song.\n\nFergie's unexpected behavior left everyone in attendance in a state of shock, but the singer still managed to make the best of the situation, joking with the audience and promoting her new song.\n\nDespite her strange behavior, we can't help but love Fergie for it! She may have stumbled onstage, but she certainly made an impact. We're still in awe of her unexpected appearance and can't wait to see what she does next!",

The acoustic versions, released in a Spotify Singles session on Friday morning, were met with a barrage of negative comments on social media, with Hollywood Life publishing a piece titled \"Twitter Needs to Seriously Chill About Taylor Swift's 'September' Cover.\" Swift's版本与EWF的版本相比，显得更加平静，与原版的欢乐形成了鲜明的对比。\n\nAt the same time, reports emerged that the press release for the songs had been altered. The second and third sentences of this paragraph were removed: \"Taylor says that she chose 'September' for sentimental reasons. She's always loved the classic tune by Earth, Wind & Fire, and notes that the month of September is especially meaningful to one of her relationships. An added layer of sentiment came from being able to record the song in a Nashville studio, the city Taylor moved at age 14 to pursue country music.\" Spin has speculated on the reasons behind the edit, as well as Swift's alteration of the date in the song's opening line, which she changes from Sept. 21 to Sept. 28.\n\nSwift's comments on the other track remained unchanged in the press release: \"Delicate' is a song about the vulnerability that immediately surfaces in all of us the minute we meet someone we want to like us,\" it reads. \"We think about everything they might've heard about us, every reason they wouldn’t want us. Every step forward toward that other person scares us, but it thrills us too. 'Delicate' is about the balancing act of the rush and the fear and hoping it's really worth it to take that chance.\"\n\nThis isn't Swift's first foray into Spotify exclusives, as she released a \"Delicate\" vertical video in recent weeks. In 2014, Swift harshly criticized the service and removed her music from all streaming platforms over what she said were unfair royalty payments. She relented with Apple a few months later, and ultimately returned all of her albums to the major services in June of last year. Her latest album, \"Reputation,\" was withheld from all streaming services until three weeks after its release last November.\n\nSwift's \"Reputation\" stadium tour is set to launch on May 8 in Arizona.",

According to the Associated Press, Moore made the bold claim, \"I want Montana to be known as a decent state.\"\n\nDespite Moore's bizarre stance, the U.S. sales for yoga clothes have increased an astounding 45 percent year over year, while participation in yoga sports has only increased by a measly 4.5 percent. This means that more and more women are embracing athleisure wear as their go-to uniform, and for good reason - yoga pants are versatile, seasonless, and most importantly, comfortable.\n\nBut just because yoga pants are comfortable, doesn't mean they should be worn anywhere and everywhere. Here are some tips on how to wear yoga pants around town without getting the side-eye:\n\nDO: Learn from Lululemon's sheer pants recall. Make sure you select a pair that is truly opaque. Test them out in broad daylight or under bright lights.\n\nDON'T: Wear them to work. Ever. \"Dress Pant Yoga Pants\" is an oxymoron.\n\nDO: Invest in the correct size. It sounds like a no-brainer, but often women will purchase a size down to get a tighter fit or a longer shelf life since yoga pants stretch out. In reality, all you end up with is \"camel toe.\" Avoid at all costs.\n\nDON'T: Show your panty lines. If thongs aren't your thing, Commando and Zobha make great full-coverage bikini bottoms that are undetectable.\n\nDO: Layer up! Throwing on a leather jacket or a dark trench over your yoga pants and T-shirt will instantly dress up your look when you're running from bikram to brunch.\n\nDON'T: Keep wearing your favorite pair after the expiration date. Unlike jeans, yoga pants don't age well. Toss them when they're overly faded, stretched or ripped.\n\nDO: Accessorize! Nothing pulls together athleisure wear like a statement handbag and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nDON'T: Try to pull off your zaniest tie-dye yoga pants outside your ashtanga class. Stock up on neutral colors — navy, black, charcoal — that will go with anything.\n\nDO: Consider your tight-fitting yoga pants a thicker alternative to leggings in the wintertime. On the weekends, pair with knee-high boots and an oversized sweater, or wear them underneath a dress. No one will know the difference.\n\nTo shop the best yoga pants on the market, click on the slideshow below.",

The message also provides tips on how to wear yoga pants without getting negative attention, but the overall tone suggests that it's a humorous exaggeration rather than a genuine declaration.

        "cs_rationale": "Based on the provided message, it appears to be satirical or fictional rather than a real news report. Several elements suggest this:\n\n1. **Greg Gianforte as Governor**: While Greg Gianforte was indeed Governor of Montana, the extreme stance against yoga pants seems exaggerated and not aligned with typical political discourse.\n\n2. **Bizarre and Extreme Claims**: The statement about wanting Montana to be known as a \"decent state\" due to banning yoga pants in public is highly unusual and provocative, which is often characteristic of satire or parody.\n\n3. **Contradictory Sales and Participation Figures**: The statistics provided (45% increase in yoga clothes sales vs. 4.5% increase in yoga participation) seem oddly specific and not typically found in serious news reports. They also serve to exaggerate the scenario.\n\n4. **Style and Tone**: The article's style, with tips on wearing yoga pants and a casual tone about athleisure wear, resembles lifestyle or fashion advice rather than serious political or societal commentary.\n\nTherefore, considering these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the message is more likely to be fictional or satirical rather than a genuine news report.

The report suggested that Rodriguez's threat was intended to send a message to Scurtis, who has been engaged in a four-year legal battle with Rodriguez. However, Rodriguez denied these allegations and stated that he would not respond to such false accusations unless it was in relation to his daughters.\n\nRodriguez is currently part of ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball\" team and was paid $21 million by the Yankees in 2016 without having to play.

Jason Phillips, CEO of the Friant Water Authority, noted that recent rainfall had not solved the long-standing problem of nearly a decade of drought.

Harris is seeking to be more like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has worked for two decades to aid the agricultural industry. However, Harris' predecessor, former Sen. Barbara Boxer, was more aligned with environmental groups, which has led to a negative view of her in the Central Valley.\n\nSome participants lobbied Harris for her support of dams that have long been under consideration by federal and state officials, particularly the Temperance Flat Dam, which would be constructed on the San Joaquin River. Harris offered no assurances on the topic, and speaking to reporters after the meeting, she said she would advocate for farmers during the crafting of a new farm bill and other measures before the Senate.\n\nWilliam Bourdeau, executive vice president of the influential Harris Farms, wished that Harris' urban supporters had a \"better understanding\" of the risks and challenges of farming.

In an exclusive interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Keith Adams revealed that the entire stunt department was kept off set the day Thurman was allegedly pressured by director Quentin Tarantino to drive a vintage convertible at high speeds, resulting in a crash that left her with a concussion and damaged her knees.\n\n“Ms. Thurman’s accident was not a stunt,” Adams emphatically stated in an email to THR. “No stunts were scheduled for that day, and no one from the stunt department was called to set. I was not consulted or notified about Ms. Thurman driving a car on camera that day.”\n\nAdams, an experienced coordinator with a specialization in automotive work, added that if he had been involved, he would have insisted on using a professional driver and ensuring the car was road-worthy and safe. He did not specify whether he believed the stunt department was intentionally kept at bay to facilitate an actor performing dangerous driving maneuvers.\n\nThurman herself has described the 1973 Karmann Ghia as a \"death box\" and claimed that the incident was the result of a cover-up by production executives. The stunt coordinator's new statement underscores Thurman's account of the incident and highlights the dangers of allowing actors to perform dangerous driving stunts on set.\n\nMany people share safety duties on set, including producers, directors, and the stunt coordinator. However, in this case, Adams admits that he did not have the opportunity to intervene when changes to the shoot were made, leaving the safety of the cast and crew at risk.\n\n“On any set, my number one priority is the safety of the cast and crew,” Adams said. “Unfortunately, I did not have that opportunity in this case.”\n\nThis new revelation adds to the growing controversy surrounding the incident and raises serious questions about the safety protocols in place on set.

The heartbreaking suit claims that Luann breached a stipulation of settlement in her divorce by failing to create a trust “for the benefit of her two children.”\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by The Blast, Luann is being accused of failing to fulfill the terms of the divorce judgment. In the judgment, Luann was required to create a trust for her children, which she agreed to do. However, the documents allege that Luann has never created the trust and instead sold the deed of the former couple’s marital residence in Bridgehampton, New York, for $8 million.\n\nThe documents state that Luann used the earnings from the sale to purchase a home in Southampton, New York, for $3.1 million. The settlement required Luann to “fund the trust with an undivided one-half interest in and to the Marital Residence.” However, the documents claim that Luann has never conveyed this interest to her children, in trust.\n\nNow, Luann’s ex-husband and two children are seeking to enforce the judgment and prevent Luann from listing or selling the home. A representative for Luann did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n\nThis emotionally triggering news highlights the heartbreak and betrayal that Luann’s ex-husband and children are experiencing. The failure to fulfill the terms of the divorce judgment is a betrayal of trust and a violation of Luann’s legal obligations.

The narrative of suspicion and potential relationship issues is plausible in the context of celebrity gossip, where rumors about celebrity relationships are frequent.\n\nHowever, without concrete evidence or direct confirmation from the individuals involved (Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez), it's challenging to verify the accuracy of these claims.

In an Instagram post shared on a beautiful Friday, she showed off her toned legs in a seductive pose, leaving many fans swooning over her beauty and confidence.\n\nThat same day, the Hills star, who is also a devoted mother, revealed the names of the costars from the show she has given parenting advice to. In a heartwarming interview with the Today show, she confessed that she has talked babies with Audrina Patridge, who welcomed her daughter last year, and Heidi Montag, who is pregnant with her first child.\n\nHowever, she did not mention Lauren Conrad or Whitney Port, who are both also pregnant with their first children. It seems that Kristin has a special bond with Audrina, as she revealed that when Audrina was pregnant, she reached out to her for advice and support.\n\n\"When Audrina was pregnant, she reached out a lot and asked me some questions, like what pregnancy jeans I liked, and that kind of stuff,\" said Kristin. \"I've talked to her since she's had the baby, and she sounds like she's just loving life.\"\n\nKristin is also very close to Heidi, who is married to Spencer Pratt. In fact, she put together a list of different products and toys that she had loved and sent that over to Heidi. \"I put together a little list of different products and toys that I've loved and sent that over to her,\" said Kristin.\n\nBeing a mother is a lot of work, especially when your boys are as rambunctious as Kristin's. \"My boys are so close in age, so one minute they're best friends and one minute they're hitting each other, punching each other,\" she said. \"They get very violent with each other...I think just right now, that's the hardest part.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Kristin is grateful for her beautiful family. \"They're so sweet, they're incredibly loving, and they love to cuddle and they love their mommy. And that's the best feeling in the entire world,\" she said.\n\nKristin also revealed that her daughter, Saylor, is a \"diva\" who loves to roughhouse and is very different from her brothers. \"She's a diva, but she's a ton of fun...She may as well be another boy because she's the third so she wants to do whatever the boys are doing. She's pretty tough,\" said Kristin.\n\nIn conclusion, Kristin Cavallari is not only a stunning mother and fashion icon, but she is also a kind and supportive friend to many of her costars.

In February 2001, the couple announced their separation, and quickly after, they filed for divorce. It was a tough year for Kidman, but it was also a professional highlight, as her performance in the film Moulin Rouge earned her her first Oscar nomination and Golden Globe award, for best actress in a motion picture - musical or comedy.\n\nAfter her divorce from Cruise, Kidman found love again with the musician Lenny Kravitz, but their relationship was brief and intense. They were even engaged, but Kidman revealed in 2017 that they had called things off in 2004. Kidman spoke about a secret fiancé to Vanity Fair in 2007, saying \"It just wasn't right. I wasn't ready. We weren't ready.\"\n\nThings are all good between Kidman and Kravitz now. She told NET-A-PORTER.com's magazine, The EDIT, \"I love Lenny; he's a great guy.\" In 2006, Kidman married her current husband, Keith Urban, in Sydney, Australia. They have two daughters together, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret. Kidman continued her career success, earning Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for her film Rabbit Hole in 2011, and a Golden Globe nod for her film The Paperboy in 2013.

Actually, we called it off.\"\n\nMcQueen, named after his grandfather, Steve McQueen, had announced the engagement news to Silva on Instagram in January, sharing a photo of the two holding hands and sharing a kiss, giving fans a glimpse of her new engagement ring. Silva reposted the photo on her own Instagram account, captioning it, \"My best friend, love of my life…YES, yes yes a million times over.\"\n\nHowever, the last photo of McQueen on Silva's account dates back to January 1, and both posts have since been deleted. It's unclear what caused the split or whether the couple plans to remain friends.\n\nBefore getting engaged, the couple had been dating for over a year. McQueen is best known for playing Jeremy Gilbert on The Vampire Diaries from 2009-15, and he has also starred in Chicago Fire and Chicago P.D.\n\nWhile many fans are heartbroken by the news, we hope that both McQueen and Silva find happiness in the future.",

The source adds that Jolie is delighted about her newfound proximity to the royal family, having longed to be close to them for years. Since Jolie's arrival in the UK, she and Camilla have developed an incredibly close bond.\n\nHowever, some believe that Camilla's intentions are not entirely benevolent. Speculations are rife that Camilla is using Jolie to ruffle feathers among other members of the royal family, specifically targeting Meghan and Kate. Camilla is said to feel that Meghan and Kate are not suitable for the royal family due to their non-aristocratic backgrounds. The source adds that Camilla is known for causing trouble for the royal women and that bringing in Jolie is just another way to do so.\n\nThe source also claims that Kate is deeply troubled by Camilla and Jolie's growing closeness, believing that Camilla is trying to betray her. Kate is said to be worried about Camilla's conniving ways and has been advised by palace aides to closely monitor her interactions with Jolie.\n\nFurthermore, author Ian Halperin has accused Jolie of wanting to 'infiltrate' the royal family, suggesting that she has studied Princess Diana in great detail and has a secret ambition to marry into the royal family. Halperin even claimed that Prince Andrew is on Jolie's radar. It is important to note that these allegations are speculative and have not been confirmed by any official sources.",

        "content": "The biggest fashion faux pas for a wedding guest would be to upstage the bride. With all the attention and speculation surrounding Kate Middleton's gown for her upcoming royal wedding, it would be nearly impossible to do. However, there are other unwritten rules that guests should consider. Don't wear white, anything too revealing, or a hat that is too wide or tall to block the view of the person behind you. You can wear tasteful black, and be sure to cover your arms.\n\n\"This is not a place to make a fashion statement for yourself,\" said Sally Kilbridge, deputy editor of Brides magazine. She goes on to list more don'ts, including no miniskirts, plunging necklines, and novelty socks, which have become a surprising trend among guests at American weddings. The attire worn to a British royal wedding is appropriate daytime wedding attire kicked up many notches, Kilbridge said. Everyone's outfit should be chic, elegant, and suit the very formal, traditional occasion while not letting glitzy, black-tie, eveningwear trappings creep in.\n\nDesigner Reem Acra thinks Westminster Abbey could be the place for cocktail frocks, especially for celebrities and fashion editors who have long found reason to wear them before noon. The fashion role model for older women should be well-cut, luxe-fabric skirt suits, while Middleton's younger friends could pull off slightly retro, Hitchcock-inspired sheaths or pencil skirts paired with nipped-waist jackets. George Kotsiopoulos, co-host of E!'s Fashion Police, expects a lot of hats, but hopes they'll be toned-down cloches or a pillbox with a veil.\n\nVivien Sheriff, a British milliner who has made several dozen custom headpieces for wedding guests, said many guests will follow the lead of Middleton's mother, Carole, who is a fan of substantial hats. The hats Sheriff has made feature some feathers and crystals, but they're not oversized. \"You can't show off too much. You don't want to overdo it, but there is a lot of expression in the headpieces.\" Sheriff added that people aren't going to want to hide their faces, so the brims won't cover them. \"This way, everyone can get good photos and you can greet other guests looking them in the eye.\"\n\nThere will be more black than one might expect, Sheriff said. She had more orders for black than she expected. \"I guess fashion has changed and a lot of young guests want to wear black.\" However, black is fine as long as it's not funereal, according to Brides' Kilbridge, although the Middleton family won't wear it. Prince Charles' wife, Camilla, won't wear it either, Kilbridge predicted. Camilla will likely pluck something she already had in her closet, Kilbridge said, probably something not unlike the tailored dress and lovely coat she wore to her own wedding.\n\nMost of the male guests will likely don a navy or gray morning suit, which is basically the daytime equivalent of a tuxedo including a vest or waistcoat. All of William's military friends will be in uniform, Kilbridge said. A guest with a well-known personal style has a little more flexibility, said Kilbridge. It would be perfectly acceptable for Elton John, for example, to wear a flashy, embroidered vest under his jacket. Fashion fans will be eager to see David and Victoria Beckham, and Kilbridge thinks they won't disappoint, although she wonders how Victoria Beckham will dress her baby bump. \"They've had some crazy fashion moments, but this won't be one of them. She'll probably look fantastic. They want to create the impression that she belongs there. I think most people will be striving to look like they belong.\" That might have singer Joss Stone, who is famously barefoot almost everywhere she goes, digging to the bottom of her closet looking for a pair of shoes.",

While everyone who owned us made the $ – how bad was it? Bad enough that I walked away from my dreams, my band mates, and a $13 million record deal. We knew we were going to be #1.”\n\nJones, a Trump supporter, further alleged that the Pussycat Dolls’ “den mother” – a reference to the group’s mentor – was responsible for breaking the girls’ spirits and encouraging them to commit suicide. “Tell the public how you mentally broke us,” she wrote.\n\nBut Jones’ shocking claims didn’t stop there. She also accused the Pussycat Dolls of abusing their power and using drugs to control the girls. “After they turn you out or get you hooked on drugs, they use it against you,” she wrote. “That’s why I have so much respect for our military.

These headlines have painted her as a \"crazy and manipulative\" estranged wife who is \"out for blood\" in the divorce fight and wants to \"embarrass and punish\" Brad by portraying him as a deadbeat dad. Furthermore, Page Six reported that Jolie had developed an \"insane jealousy\" of Amal Clooney, which caused her to believe that Amal has stolen her identity as the world's most glamorous and admired humanitarian.\n\nDespite these negative headlines, Jolie also published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency's efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children. The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.\n\nIn her piece, Jolie shared moving accounts of what education means to children whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war. She met these girls during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can't read or write, and has been \"robbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.\"\n\nJolie argues that wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war by providing resources such as school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps. She concludes that helping refugees in a \"patient, long-term manner, guided by our values\" is the wise and morally right course of action.",

The husband of Jill Duggar, star of “19 Kids and Counting,” was first accused of targeting transgender star Jazz Jennings, star of “I Am Jazz.”\n\nIn August, Dillard slammed the show as an “oxymoron” and declared that “transgender” is a myth. “Gender is not fluid; it’s ordained by God,” he wrote. But his hateful comments didn’t stop there. Last week, he doubled down, pitying Jazz and calling out the parents who allow her to promote her agenda.\n\nHowever, the backlash was swift and fierce. Fans and critics slammed Dillard for his ignorance and lack of respect. One wrote, “You claim to love everyone, yet you can’t call a transgender female by her correct pronouns.” Another said, “You are a hateful person. I mean it from the bottom of my heart.”\n\nIn a statement, TLC confirmed that Dillard has been cut from the show and will not be featured in future episodes. The network said his personal statements do not reflect its views and it is proud to share the story of Jazz and her family.\n\nDespite the controversy, “Counting On” will continue to follow Jazz and her journey as a transgender youth. TLC stands with Jazz and all those who fight for acceptance and equality.\"",

The board, who reviewed Weinstein's membership during an emergency meeting, released a statement saying it \"voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority to immediately expel him from the Academy.\"\n\nThe statement from the Academy read, \"We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over. What’s at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society. The Board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.\"\n\nMia Farrow, whose son Ronan recently published a New Yorker investigation with rape and sexual assault allegations against Weinstein's, took to Twitter to express her support of the board's decision. She wrote, \"I'm proud of the Academy for voting to expel Harvey Weinstein. Hopelessly grateful that we are witnessing the end of an awful era.\"\n\nRon Perlman also expressed his pride in the Academy's decision to expel Weinstein, tweeting, \"I'm proud of their decision to expel Harvey Weinstein. Time to make Hollywood great again.\"\n\nMarlee Matlin tweeted her support for the Academy, highlighting the issue of willful ignorance and complicity, tweeting, \"Bravo to the Academy for highlighting willful ignorance and complicity.\"\n\nThis move comes after several Hollywood figures known for alleged sexual misconduct, including Roman Polanski and Bill Cosby, remain members of the Academy. Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual assault by numerous actresses, becomes the second person ever to be kicked out of the Academy, after Godfather actor Carmine Caridi, who was removed in 2004 for illegally sharing Oscar screeners.\n\nThe Weinstein Company, which he helped to found, has fired him, and his wife, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Weinstein's brother Bob spoke of his \"waking nightmare\" and expressed his desire for his brother to receive \"the justice he deserves.\"\n\nThe fallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal continues more than a week after an explosive New York Times investigation detailed decades of sexual harassment accusations against Weinstein.

The women also acknowledged the efforts of those standing for change and called for the industry's stairways to be accessible to all.\n\nThe protest was part of the 5050x2020 movement, which seeks to achieve gender parity across all aspects of the film industry by the year 2020. The number 82 was selected to match the number of films directed by women in the festival's history, with only 4.3% of competition films in the past 71 years being directed by women.\n\nOther notable women involved in the protest included Salma Hayek, Marion Cotillard, director Patty Jenkins, and Haifaa al-Mansour. The protest was organized by French group Le Deuxieme Regard and the 5050x2020 collective, in collaboration with the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe protest comes in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #MeToo and Time's Up movements, which have sparked a renewed demand for change in the film industry. The movement also echoes broader calls for gender equality and diversity in the workplace.\n\nWhile progress has been made in recent years, with more women making the cut in competition, the statistics for women in Cannes are still dismal. Only one woman has won the Palme d'Or, and only one woman has been named Best Director. The festival has been criticized for its lack of diversity and inclusion, and for failing to provide a platform for women filmmakers.\n\nHowever, the rise of women in the film industry is undeniable, and the protest at Cannes highlights the need for continued efforts to promote gender equality and diversity in the industry. As the movement continues to gain momentum, it remains to be seen what concrete actions will be taken to address these issues and create a more inclusive and equitable film industry.",

In a moment that will resonate with all moms, Alba took to a Target fitting room to find a spot to feed her baby.\n\nThe \"Dark Angel\" actress, who is also the co-founder of the Honest Company, shared a photo of herself feeding Hayes on Instagram, captioning it with the simple words \"Tired eyes\" and \"Breastfeeding in a Target dressing room.\"\n\nTarget has a breastfeeding policy that is mommy-friendly, even in fitting rooms if others are waiting. And it's not just Alba who appreciates this. Many moms have praised Target for creating a welcoming and comfortable space for nursing mothers.\n\nAlba, who is also a mom to Honor Marie, 9, and Haven Garner, 6, has been open about breastfeeding her 7-week-old son. She even shared updates on social media while watching Netflix and even after going to the spa.\n\nDespite her success, Alba still feels the typical pressures of motherhood, including impromptu nursing breaks. But she knows that it's important to maintain her own sense of self and to just do the best she can.\n\n“Any mom who all of the sudden has little people that rely heavily on them for survival needs to maintain her own sense of self,” Alba told TODAY. “You need to cut yourself some slack and bite off what you can chew. Things will be compromised and you just have to be okay with that.”\n\nAlba's hope for her kids is simple - that they are happy and that they are developing a positive relationship with the world around them.\n\n“I just pray that my kids are happy,” the strong mom said back in 2015. “If they’re giggling more than they’re crying, and if they’re curious and talkative, then I know they’re good.”\n\nThis is just one example of the many ways that moms are doing their best to balance their own needs with the needs of their little ones. And it's a reminder that we should all be supportive of each other, no matter what stage of motherhood we are in.\"",

While it's true that Teresa played a role in their financial struggles, it's hard not to feel sorry for Joe. He's the one who has to serve a year in prison because of his actions. It's a harsh reality that no one wants to face, but it's clear that Joe made some shady business decisions that led to their downfall.\n\n52. Kelsey Grammer, the beloved actor and comedian from Cheers and Frasier, shocked the world when he divorced his wife Camille on the first season of this show. It was a painful and emotional decision, and it seemed as though Kelsey had little interest in being near Camille during their time together. At least Camille walked away with a boatload of money, but the pain and heartache of their divorce will always be a part of their lives.\n\n51. The loss of Yolanda Hadid Foster's life to Lyme disease was a tragedy for all who knew her. As soon as this news became public, there was a feeling that her husband, the smarmy Grammy-winner and serial reality-television participant David Foster, would dump his fourth wife. And sure enough, he did. The end of their marriage was heartbreaking, and it's clear that David was struggling with his own emotions as well.\n\n50. The Ashley Madison hacking scandal was a shock to everyone, including Josh Taekman, the condescending entrepreneur and serial bad-hat-wearer from the Real Housewives of New York.

The fallout from this scandal has been devastating, and it's clear that Josh has a lot of work to do to repair his relationships and reputation.\n\n49. The divorce between Kordell Stewart and Porsha Williams was a painful and difficult decision for both parties. Sure, Porsha's rumors about Kordell's sexual orientation were unkind, but the former NFL player didn't treat his young wife all that well onscreen, either.
