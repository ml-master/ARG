In a TikTok video that has gone viral, Frankel reveals that she had a negative experience with the actor years ago and believes he was \"put upon\" by the situation.\n\nFrankel, 51, opens up about her encounter with Hill on the set of Jay Leno's The Tonight Show, saying, \"He was a low-grade d**k to me. I felt like a loser and the nobody that I was.\" However, she quickly distances herself from the drama surrounding Hill and Brady and questions the timing of their explosive claims.\n\n\"I don’t know the whole story, I only read the snippets of headlines, but if you're in a relationship with someone for one year, are texts fair game?\" Frankel asks, adding that the notion of publicly sharing texts from exes is \"frightening.\"\n\nDespite her past negative experience with Hill, Frankel believes it's not okay to be \"emotionally harmful\" to your partner, something Brady has accused Hill of. Frankel's message is clear: Hill may have treated her poorly years ago, but that does not justify the explosive allegations that have rocked the actor's reputation.\n\nFrankel's support for Hill comes as a surprise to many, given her history of speaking out against emotional abuse. However, the reality star is known for always speaking her mind and standing up for what she believes is right, even if it goes against popular opinion.\n\nAs the drama surrounding Hill and Brady continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the world is watching closely and waiting for Frankel's next move.

The YouTube star and actor sat down with Good Morning America's Michael Strahan for a wide-ranging interview, where he admitted to being a \"good guy who made a bad decision.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Paul explained that his original plan was to create a fun blog and make an entertaining video in a forest. However, things quickly took a drastic and negative turn. Paul's original video, which he took down within a day, generated massive backlash and criticism for showing the face of the suicide victim.\n\nDespite facing death threats and criticism from millions of people, Paul remains defiant and believes that he is spreading the message about suicide prevention in the right way. He also revealed that he has been receiving death threats, which he described as \"tough\" but \"not like I'm drowning.\"\n\nWhen Strahan asked whether Paul feels like the criticism has been fair, he responded, \"That's the thing. I do.\" However, he also added that he respects YouTube's decision to remove him from their premium advertising program and suspend all projects with him.\n\nDespite the financial impact of the controversy, Paul remains optimistic and believes that creating and making other people happy makes him happy. He also expressed his gratitude to his fans, who have largely supported him over the last month.\n\nThe interview is a must-listen for all Logan Paul fans, as he finally addresses the backlash that has been swirling around him since the release of his controversial video.

The 51-year-old fitness icon took to Instagram to share the news with his followers, captioning a post: \"Yesterday was a BIG DAY in my recovery from my heart attack. I finished my cardiac rehab. It has been super important to me and also HUMBLING. All the support that I've been getting from all my IG friends helped me when it was tough so THANK YOU for all the love and support.\"\n\nThe post features a heart drawn in red chalk, with the words \"Rehab\" and \"36/36\" scrawled inside, symbolizing Harper's successful completion of cardiac rehab. The trainer's image is a testament to his resilience and strength, as he continues to fight for his health and wellbeing.\n\nBack in February, Harper was working out with friends when he suddenly collapsed, falling to the ground and stopping breathing. \"I was in full cardiac arrest,\" he revealed to Savannah Guthrie on TODAY in April. \"My heart stopped. Not to be dramatic, but I was dead. I was on that ground dead.\"\n\nThankfully, two doctors who were in the gym at the time administered CPR and used a defibrillator before paramedics arrived to take Harper to the hospital. After being admitted to the hospital, Harper was placed in a medically induced coma for two days and underwent two stents to keep his arteries open and reduce the risk of future heart attacks.\n\nHarper later discovered that he had suffered a heart attack due to high levels of a particle in his blood known as lipoprotein(a), a condition that is hereditary. His mother, a heart attack victim, serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of knowing one's health.\n\nDespite the challenges he has faced, Harper remains optimistic and grateful for the support of his friends and followers. \"It's been hard,\" he told Savannah. \"I'm going through some depression. You really face your mortality. And I'm really understanding what's important in life.\" His resilience and positive attitude serve as an inspiration to his fans, who continue to rally around him as he continues on his journey to wellness.",

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's upcoming nuptials are set to be the most talked-about event of the year, and they'll definitely be unlike any other royal wedding you've ever seen. Here's what we know so far about how the wedding will be a total departure from the 2011 ceremony between Prince William and Kate Middleton.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kensington Palace made the announcement that the wedding will take place in May 2018 at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, with the Queen giving her approval for the venue. The royal family will foot the bill for the wedding, and Windsor Castle, where the Queen calls home for part of every year, is located about 20 miles west of London. \"Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,\" Kensington Palace said in a statement. Harry himself was christened there in 1984, so by the rules of the Church of England, he can be married there.\n\nBut what really sets Harry and Meghan's wedding apart from any other royal affair? For starters, it won't be the first time a recent royal has married at St. George's. According to NBC News, Harry's uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999, and his cousin, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at the chapel in 2008. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles had a televised religious blessing there after they had a civil wedding ceremony nearby in 2005.\n\nSt. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle is a much smaller space than Westminster Abbey, holding around 800 people compared to the Abbey's whopping 2,000. Harry and Meghan plan on making the ceremony a reflection of their personalities and they're working on a way to involve the public in some way, their spokesman revealed. The couple wants the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family, but they also want the public to feel part of the celebrations.\n\n“It will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the character of the bride and groom,?their spokesman told journalists. “The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family. They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved.?Get ready for the most talked-about royal wedding of the century!",

The couple's intimate ceremony will take place in Mexico, where they first fell in love on last year's Paradise. Chris Harrison will officiate the ceremony, which will take place at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June.\n\nHowever, the state of their wedding hit a snag when production on the series was suspended in June after a June 4 sexual encounter between two cast members who had been drinking. A producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air.\n\nBass and Waddell remain one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise and they now have their first child on the way. When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going.\n\n\"We were sort of in that wedding glow,\" Bass explains. \"It felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.\"\n\nThe morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return.\n\nIn the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set - something Harrison will discuss with the cast, also on Tuesday's episode.\n\nBass and Waddell say they are ready to pass the torch to another couple this season. \"There's going to be another couple this season that takes our place,\" says Bass. \"You can’t let the haters affect your relationship. There’s no way it doesn’t affect you, but you have to work through that together. It’s crazy how one person’s tweet affects you.\"\n\nLooking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show - and potentially the series - would ever resume. \"I felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,\" he now says. \"I trust everyone that’s a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back.\"\n\nAnd Waddell adds, \"We’re so excited to watch the season. The show has such a dear place in our hearts.\"",

It's a reminder that we are not alone and that we can find hope and healing.\" Dorfman also shared his own personal struggles with mental health, writing, \"I struggled with addiction and depression issues through high school and early college. I reached out and asked for help. At the time, I thought my life was over, I thought I'd never live past the age of 21. Today I'm grateful to be alive, in this new chapter of life in recovery, standing with my colleagues and friends, making art that helps other people.\"\n\nGomez's advocacy for mental health awareness and her willingness to share her own struggles have been instrumental in bringing attention to the issue and reducing the stigma surrounding mental health.

        "content": "\"SHOCKER: TV Powerhouse Shonda Rhimes Ditches Disney for Netflix, Ending 15 Years of ABC Stardom!\"\n\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves throughout the entertainment industry, Shonda Rhimes, the creative mastermind behind hit TV shows such as \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"How to Get Away with Murder,\" has announced that she is leaving ABC Studios to join the ranks of Netflix.\n\nThis decision is a major blow to Disney, Rhimes' home for the past 15 years, and to broadcast TV in general. Rhimes has been one of the most reliable hitmakers in prime time in the past dozen years, and her departure will leave a huge void in the industry.\n\nAccording to sources close to Rhimes, the showrunner is ready to move on to a new chapter of her career, one that will give her and her Shondaland factory far more room to maneuver from a creative perspective.\n\nHowever, broadcast TV is still the biggest platform in the traditional TV universe, but it has become increasingly less attractive to creatives, especially those like Rhimes who have nothing left to prove in the network TV arena.\n\nAs development for the 2018-19 season cranks into high gear, industry insiders are grousing about a general stasis when it comes to dealmaking and a lack of ambition in programming at a time when the array of material on competing outlets has never been more diverse.\n\nOn the flip side, network executives privately say they feel like they're under siege. Success for them is still defined by broad-based hits, but smaller rivals are forking over significantly more money and perks to draw high-wattage talent.\n\nABC's perspective on Rhimes' departure is complicated. While it's hard to watch her walk out the door, she's still doing a lot of day-to-day business with them and will be for the foreseeable future.\n\nRhimes has no less than five series in various stages of production, including \"Grey's,\" \"HTGAWM,\" the final season of \"Scandal,\" new midseason legal drama \"For the People,\" and the untitled \"Grey's Anatomy\" spinoff revolving around firefighters. And there's at least one Shondaland pilot in the hopper for the 2018-19 season.\n\nABC Studios has expanded its focus to producing shows for non-ABC outlets, including its Marvel series for Netflix and the Showtime comedy \"SMILF.\" However, the appeal of a heavy courtship from Netflix is easy to understand. No ratings, more creative control, subject matter that need not be mass appeal - for a showrunner who has worked at a prolific pace for 15 years, what's not to love?\n\nRhimes' deal is unlike any other talent pact that Netflix has made to date. The company will provide generous overhead for Shondaland and its roughly 30 employees. Rhimes herself will see hefty upfront payments for her work on various shows.\n\nEven more than the bottom-line concerns, the optics of Rhimes deciding to change lanes and channel her creative energy into Netflix productions is a hit to broadcast TV's image. The showrunner will keep one foot firmly planted in her legacy shows for the time being - but for the future, Rhimes has voted with her feet.",

The source further claimed that Markle has been confined to the palace and has been unable to attend gym classes or jog around Hyde Park. The only person she has been able to spend time with is Kate Middleton, but the Duchess of Cambridge has been busy with her own duties and pregnancy.\n\nThe insider added that Markle's \"frustrations are simmering beneath the surface,\" but that once the wedding is over, she will be able to start building her royal career and some of her frustration will disappear. However, Gossip Cop has debunked this report, as an insider has told the rumor-debunking site that the claims are not true.\n\nIn January of this year, New Idea also reported that Markle was feeling the \"strain\" of being a royal. A source claimed that while Markle appeared composed in public, \"behind closed doors, the star is starting to feel the strain.\" Markle was said to have told her friends that she did not realize it was the life she had signed up for.\n\nHowever, it was later learned that this report was false. Nothing is \"falling apart\" for Markle, who is reported to be happy and enjoying her decision to be with Prince Harry. In fact, she has already stated that her decision to quit acting did not mean that she was giving up her career, but rather that she preferred to work with the man of her life.\n\n\"I don't see it as giving anything up,\" Markle told the BBC. \"I just see it as a change. It's a new chapter, right? And also, keep in mind, I've been working on ['Suits'] for seven years. We were very, very fortunate to have that sort of longevity on a series…I've ticked this box, and I feel very proud of the work I've done there, and now it's time to work with [Harry] as a team.\"\n\nMarkle and Prince Harry are set to marry on May 19, 2018, at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, England.

She admits that while it can be a source of connection and entertainment, it can also be a source of unhappiness and self-doubt.\n\n\"I really hate how Instagram makes me feel, and I hate how Twitter and any kind of social media makes me feel,\" she says. \"Whether I'm looking at other people's lives or how I portray my life, I just hate the whole thing.

Many expressed their disappointment and concern for her daughter, Sophia. One person wrote, \"My god...poor little Sophia. A mother who ‘loves?her body so much she altered every bit of it. Great example. I hope Sophia will grow into a strong and independent woman who does not need her ‘mother?to be around.\"\n\nAnother commented, \"Farrah why?

On Monday night, the Countess took to the stage for another round of her cabaret show, #CountessAndFriends, from Feinstein's/54 Below in New York City.\n\nDuring the Q&A session, a fan asked if de Lesseps would ever consider reconciling with Medley. The two, both 53, had an explosive argument on the show's tenth season, which began when de Lesseps questioned Medley's drinking habits during a vacation with their castmates in Cartagena, Colombia. Medley's response was to mock de Lesseps for her headline-making arrest and trip to rehab.\n\nFurther insults were exchanged at the season 10 reunion, where Medley claimed that de Lesseps only sought treatment to avoid jail time and that she had become \"confused between fame and infamy\" after her cabaret show took off. The hurtful words still linger for de Lesseps. \"What she said hurts still,\" she admitted. \"I'm just trying to process it and get over it right now. I'm not ready to take the Band-Aid off. I'm still scarred from it!\"\n\nDespite the ongoing pain, de Lesseps remains hopeful that she and Medley can reconcile. \"I do [want to make up with her]. I love Dorinda,\" she said. \"We've known each other for a long time. I'm sure we'll come to a good decision.\"\n\nJohn Lamparski/Getty\n\nDe Lesseps was equally uncompromising during her appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on September 5. She denied the claim that she was court-ordered to go to rehab and defended her attitude towards the success of her cabaret show. \"Yeah, I'm not taking advice, right now, from Dorinda,\" she said. \"Thank you for those two cents. But I will say, my cabaret, to me, is everything. I've found my calling in my life and if that makes them uncomfortable, that is too bad for them. That's all I can say. When I do my shows, I'm on stage and I'm doing my thing, so I don't let [the boozy environment] really affect me. I understand their concern and I appreciate it, but I'm good because I'm on stage doing what I love.\"\n\nThat same positivity was evident on Monday night as de Lesseps took to the stage and sang about finding her calling in life. She was supported in the crowd by Real Housewives of New York City costars Sonja Morgan and Teresa Giudice, who performed with her. The three women shared a heartfelt moment as they celebrated the joys of self-expression and the strength it takes to pursue one's dreams.\n\nAs de Lesseps prepares for more performances of #CountessAndFriends, she remains committed to healing from the pain caused by her falling out with Medley. \"I'm doing what I love,\" she told the crowd. \"I found my calling.\" The additional shows will be announced on her official website shortly.",

Carey has reportedly been insistent that Pink slow down and spend more time together as a family to avoid another split.\n\nThe source added that Pink is unwell and her health is taking a toll, but Carey's concerns about her schedule are also a factor in the couple's relationship.

But for Langford, saying goodbye to her first major role was bittersweet.\n\n\"In all honesty, no. I think [showrunner] Brian’s [Yorkey] always had an idea about how many episodes that I would be in, but this season was interesting because unlike last season, it was completely new territory,\" Langford told Entertainment Weekly. \"We weren’t based on a book, and particularly for Hannah, it was something that was developed over the course of shooting, but I think that ultimately it was important to have her back for a second season and assist in continuing the dialogue from season 1 and following a lot of the other characters this season, particularly Clay.\"\n\nBut playing Hannah this season was a challenge for Langford. \"Season 1 was something that I could really sink my teeth into and pour myself into the character, whereas this season was challenging as an actor because I had to put a lot of faith and a lot of trust into the writers and the directors in making sure that what I was doing was right and their vision,\" she explained. \"I think what everyone learned over the course of shooting and developing her was that you don’t see the same Hannah this season, and that’s for a number of reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is that every time we see Hannah this season, it’s either through flashbacks or filtered through the eyes of someone else. Or it’s through the eyes of Clay as a presence. You only ever see her through the eyes of someone else.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Langford was proud of the work they did with Hannah's story. \"For me, we told Hannah’s story so fully in season 1,\" she said. \"And in a way, doing that scene in episode 13 [of season 1], I’ve so often referred to it as it was the hardest scene because it’s the scene where I had to let her go. I think coming back this season was challenging because it was playing her but not really her. The challenge was when you tell a character’s story so fully, and then you have to come back as a version of her that’s filtered through other people’s eyes; that required a lot of trust.\"\n\nLangford hopes that people will take away from Hannah's story that \"it doesn’t matter who she was or what she did, she didn’t deserve any of what happened to her.\" And as for her career, playing Hannah was just one of many highlights for Langford, who is also in Love, Simon and has another film, Spontaneous, coming soon. \"13 Reasons Why will always be a really special part of my life,\" she said. \"But I’m also really excited for what’s to come.\"",

These certifications not only enhance the instructor's credibility, but also instill confidence in clients.\n\nThe job outlook for fitness workers is expected to grow at a faster-than-average rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is due in part to the growing obesity epidemic and the aging population, which both contribute to a continued demand for fitness instructor services.

The median salary of a fitness instructor was $29,210 in May 2008.\n\nFitness centers often require instructors to have a college education in exercise, nutrition, or wellness. College majors may include exercise science, physical education, or kinesiology, which is the study of human motion. Instructors must also have training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), either through college or the Red Cross.\n\nCertification is an important aspect of becoming a fitness instructor. Instructors who are certified have demonstrated their knowledge and expertise in a particular exercise program. Many agencies offer certification programs for various exercise programs, such as Pilates or aerobics. American Fitness Professionals and Associates also offers several certification programs, including specialization in sports nutrition, children's fitness, and prenatal exercise.\n\nFitness instructors must possess certain personality traits to be successful. They must be confident, enthusiastic, and able to motivate clients to maintain an exercise routine.

Instructors should also be in good shape and able to engage in the same exercises they ask of their clients.\n\nClient expectations for fitness instructors are high.

The program will air in the early afternoon, extending the franchise's presence to ABC's daytime schedule and allowing the network to create larger advertising packages. The launch is also expected to boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main \"GMA\" broadcast.\n\nThe new hour will be taped, not live, and will air at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One possibility for the show's format involves using the live, in-studio audience from the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. The move follows a short-lived attempt to expand \"GMA's\" afternoon presence in 2012, when Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored \"Good Afternoon America.\"\n\nABC's \"Good Morning America\" remains the most-watched morning program, but its main rival, \"Today,\" co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. As of July 13, \"Today\" has attracted 151,000 more viewers in that demographic than \"GMA,\" while \"GMA\" has a total viewership advantage of 63,000.\n\nThe expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the show's digital presence. In April, \"GMA\" launched a morning newsletter and a revamped website, separate from ABC News' content deal with Yahoo. The senior executive producer of \"GMA,\" Michael Corn, noted that the show often produces more content than can be covered in the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program.\n\nHaines will leave \"The View\" to participate in the new program, following the departure of ABC News correspondent Faris to focus on reporting bigger stories. The move leaves \"The View\" with four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin, and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third \"GMA\" hour were previously reported by Page Six.",

However, according to a report from Life & Style (via Gossip Cop), the rapper does not engage in actual exercise once he arrives at the studio.\n\nThe insider claims that despite wearing workout gear and following Pasternak's lead, West loses interest in the exercises and does not participate. Pasternak finds this puzzling since West spends significant money on working with a celebrity personal trainer. However, the source suggests that Pasternak is essentially being paid to simply watch West stand around rather than motivate him to exercise.\n\nThe outlet quotes the source as saying that West's fitness studio is one of his favorites. While he has the motivation and dedication to improve his physical fitness, he often does little to nothing once he arrives at the studio, the source alleges.\n\nThe insider explains that Pasternak attempts to guide West in the right direction, but the rapper is not interested in following through with the exercises. When Pasternak demonstrates an exercise on one machine, West nods in agreement, but then they move to another machine and repeat the same exercise.\n\nDespite Pasternak's efforts, the source claims that West is not committed to improving his fitness and does not put in the necessary effort. The rumor about West's laziness at the gym comes on the heels of reports that he is still recovering from his mental breakdown, which hospitalized him for eight days in November.\n\nSome fans have speculated that West's mental breakdown may be to blame for his lack of motivation at the gym. However, others believe that he simply struggles with staying focused and engaged in his workouts.\n\nOverall, it appears that Kanye West is not as committed to his fitness as he could be, despite working with a personal trainer and visiting a gym regularly.

The opening track, \"Your Heartless Void,\" features a four-track demo that the girls recorded before being signed to a major label. The song's honest and sincere lyrics about the emptiness of modern romance and the importance of avoiding a meaningless existence are accompanied by a haunting classical guitar performance from Ashley-Olsen, reminiscent of early minimalist works by Lou Reed.\n\nThe following two tracks, \"Stabbing and Punching\" and \"Toothless Rookie,\" showcase the twins' brief dalliance with the punk scene. Despite the repetitive power chords and simplistic bridge-solos, the lyrics maintain a level of depth and meaning previously reserved for bands like The Ramones or The Clash. \"Stabbing\" in particular stands out, with Mary-Kate's powerful ending of screaming, \"You can rip out my heart, but you'll never take my soul you filthy [expletive]!\"\n\nThe next five tracks on the album are considered the weakest, with their focus on ponies and their various attributes. While these tracks are amusing in a contextually humorous way, they do tend to drone on.\n\nThe final three tracks on the album are considered the highlights, and are what have solidified the twins' status as a musical powerhouse. The production levels are greatly improved upon with the addition of Nigel Goodrich, and the songs showcase the twins' diverse range and songwriting abilities. \"I Wanna Dance All Night\" is a club anthem about dancing at all-night raves and meeting men of wealth and power, while \"4 All My Posse\" showcases the twins' take on gangsta rap. The album concludes with a country song about a missing cat, featuring subtle sonic brilliance.\n\nOverall, this is a solid compilation that provides a retrospective look at the twins' musical journey and highlights their growth as artists.",

But behind the glamour and fame, there have been allegations of toxic work environments and constant labour code violations. Now, two former bodyguards have come forward with a new lawsuit, detailing the \"stress-related injuries\" they suffered while protecting Depp.\n\nEugene Arreola and Miguel Sanchez, both private security professionals, claim that they were hired by Depp in 2016 to protect him from himself and his vices. They were told they would be classified as \"employees\" and would receive all the protections and benefits they were entitled to under the law.\n\nBut things quickly spiralled out of control, they allege. They were asked to drive vehicles that contained illegal substances and minors, and were asked to monitor unstable individuals in Depp's life and entourage. They were forced to become caretakers for him, protecting him from himself and his vices while in public.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Arreola and Sanchez were not paid overtime wages despite working 12-hour shifts and were not given their legally mandated meal and rest breaks. They claim that they were exposed to unsafe conditions and situations, which led to stress-related injuries.\n\nThe suit further alleges that their direct supervisor, Leonard Damian, was responsible for many of the toxic and dangerous work environment and constant labour code violations. Damian is claimed to have accidentally shot himself in the leg while playing with his weapon in a small control room on Depp's property.\n\nDespite enjoying their jobs and having no ill will towards Depp, the bodyguards were forced to leave their jobs. They are seeking all wages and penalties due to them, plus interest, as well as damages for alleged unpaid overtime and meal breaks, as well as payment for their attorney's fees and court costs.\n\nET has reached out to a rep for Depp for comment.",

He and his brother, Marc, pleaded guilty to filing falsified tax returns on nearly $9 million, a crime that defrauded the government out of $550,000 to $1.5 million in tax revenue.\n\nSorrentino, a beloved star of the hit show \"Jersey Shore,\" was initially indicted with his brother in 2014 for tax offenses and conspiring to defraud the United States. But the Department of Justice added charges last year, and Sorrentino was sentenced to two years in prison for his role in the fraud.\n\nSorrentino's accountant, Gregg Mark, admitted to filing the fraudulent returns in December 2015 in a Newark, New Jersey, federal court. Mark has not yet been sentenced, but he faces the same charges of tax evasion and structuring funds to evade currency transaction reports that landed his brother in prison.\n\nThe government included charges of tax evasion and structuring funds to evade currency transaction reports in April of 2017. Sorrentino and his brother created businesses to exploit the reality star's celebrity status and did not pay the required income tax on the $8.9 million Sorrentino earned between 2010 and 2012.\n\nSorrentino failed to file a personal tax return in 2011, instead filing a false corporate return for Situation Nation Inc. and concealing his cash income. He made multiple cash deposits in amounts less than $10,000 into different bank accounts on the same day in order to evade bank reporting regulations, according to his 2017 indictment.\n\nThe entire cast of \"Jersey Shore\" went to Sorrentino's sentencing on Friday in a show of support. But even with the support of his former castmates, Sorrentino's future is uncertain.\n\nSorrentino skyrocketed into fame in 2009 after being cast in MTV's reality series \"Jersey Shore.\" The show featured a group of young men and women living a house in Seaside, New Jersey, while working at a local t-shirt printing business. Sorrentino and the rest of the cast engaged in excessive partying and binge drinking on the show.\n\n\"Jersey Shore\" went on for six seasons before its cancellation in 2012. The show was revived by MTV earlier this year as \"Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.\" Sorrentino returned to film the series despite his legal and personal issues. The star became addicted to painkillers after a 2010 injury on ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars,\" and entered rehab for the first time two years later. But in 2015, after cracking his ribs, he relapsed.\n\nSorrentino's legal troubles began in 2014, when he was arrested for cocaine possession in Miami Beach. He spent a month in jail before entering rehab. In 2018, he was arrested again for possession of oxycodone and heroin in Asbury Park.\n\nDespite his personal struggles, Sorrentino remained committed to his family, especially his wife and young children. He posted a heartfelt message on Instagram after his sentencing, thanking his family and friends for their support.\n\nBut now, with his prison sentence looming, Sorrentino's future is uncertain. Will he be able to serve his time and rebuild his life? Will he be able to return to his wife and children after his release? Only time will tell.",

Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.\"\n\nTheir divorce was not just about the scandal that had engulfed them, but also about the dwindling fortunes of one and the sturdy fortune of the other.

According to TMZ, Chapman stands to receive $400,000 annually for every year of marriage to Weinstein, a figure that would add up to a total of $11.75 million as of December of this year. In addition to that annual sum, she would reportedly receive a $250,000 bonus per year of marriage up until her sixth year, when that figure was reportedly bumped to $700,000.\n\nThere are several reasons why the couple has not yet filed for divorce, despite the fact that their marriage has hit the 10-year mark on December 15, their wedding anniversary.

Unlike the typical true crime documentaries that aired on CBS, Investigation Discovery, Lifetime, and Dr. Phil last year, this film offers no new puzzle pieces or insight into the crime.\n\nInstead, the film focuses on local actors in the Boulder community, who are featured in limited reenactments, and the popular theories about the case. Filmmakers spent 15 months meeting with Coloradans and seeking out their beliefs about the crime.\n\nDuring their auditions, many reveal a tie to the incident, with a voice teacher's students knowing JonBenét, a hopeful vying for the part of Patsy, revealing her parents met the Ramsey matriarch and patriarch \"several times,\" and another actor revealing he was \"effectively (his girlfriend's) alibi.\"\n\nThe amateur thespians recall details of JonBenét's death, though not everyone's speech is dripping with confidence or certainty. They talk about the ransom note, totaling almost three pages, which was addressed on CBS' docu-series The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey last September. Their comments are similar to ones that could be heard at a brunch with friends discussing the latest episode of the popular podcast My Favorite Murder.\n\nThe film's centerpiece is not a child's untimely and cryptic death, but the subsequent conversations and attitudes formed about a family that intrigues many but few actually know. With the media, some sensationalized reports, and a surplus of shows surrounding the 20th anniversary of the crime, this film raises questions about whether we are so desperate to make sense of the senseless act that we cling to theories even if it means persecuting innocent people.",

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's twin joy may have been influenced by Harry's genetics. Harry's uncle, his mother Princess Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, has identical twin daughters, and the royal's great-grandfather, Edmund Maurice Burke Roche, the fourth Baron Fermoy, was also an identical twin.\n\nOne insider told the Enquirer, \"We all know where the genes for twins comes from - and it wasn't the House of Windsor on Harry's side! You might romantically say this is Diana's last gift to her youngest son.\"\n\nA friend added to Life & Style, \"She just can't wait to be a mother.\" Harry is reportedly eager to be a dad as well.\n\nThe palace insider claims that Queen Elizabeth is also excited about the news. The palace insider reportedly stated, \"She's been nagging Harry for months about how she can't wait for him to extend the family.

I felt weak at the knees and I was overwhelmed with how I felt, but then it took me about 10 months to get the courage up to actually do anything about it.\"\n\nIn 2008, DeGeneres announced her plans to marry de Rossi on her talk show, following the news that the California Supreme Court had struck down a law banning same-sex marriage.

And in a battle that leaves the viewer breathless, Spielberg emerges victorious.\n\nIf you're a fan of the 2011 Ernest Cline best-seller, you may not use the term \"banality\" to describe the story, but you'd have to acknowledge \"familiarity\" as a suitable replacement. We're transported back to the dystopian world of 2045, where millions of people are trapped in the virtual reality world of the OASIS, created by the late tech genius played by Mark Rylance.\n\nThe story is a digitized version of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" with the sweetly mad inventor hidden clues to three keys within the OASIS, and whoever finds all three becoming the heir to a massive fortune. Much of the film's thrilling first hour explores the ever-changing environments and rules within the OASIS, with a heartfelt quest for a real connection at its core.\n\nAs Wade/Parzival, played by Tye Sheridan, navigates through the virtual worlds, he faces off against corporate evil and the sniveling face of adversity, portrayed by Ben Mendelsohn. While the visual referencing is happily relentless, the film runs a bit long, with 140 minutes feeling overgenerous for the amount and quality of the narrative at hand.\n\nIn the later stages of the story, the routine complications and challenges posed by the Mendelsohn character and his aide, played by Hannah John-Kamen, bring the story to a close. But Spielberg's control of pacing, rhythm, action dynamics, and tone keeps the story from getting lost in the nostalgia-filled fly-by jokes and references.\n\nIn the end, Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\" stands as a testament to his mastery of storytelling and direction. It's a film that not only captures the hearts of its viewers but also challenges them to think about the future of virtual reality and the impact it will have on our lives.",

The release comes at a fitting time to honor fathers, as it allows them to imagine themselves as action heroes for their children.\n\nThe Blu-ray version of the film will include a commentary track by director Eli Roth and producer Roger Birnbaum, a grindhouse-style trailer, a featurette focusing on Roth's direction, extended scenes featuring deejays Mancow and Sway, and deleted scenes with optional Roth/Birnbaum commentary. One of these deleted scenes, which takes place shortly after Paul Kersey (played by Bruce Willis) has an uncomfortable encounter at a school sporting event for his daughter, has been premiered.\n\nThe scene shows why it was not included in the final cut of the film.

In 2013, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning from her doctors that she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, also had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer when she was just 56 years old. Jolie's double mastectomy lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5%, and she followed it up with a reconstructive surgery involving allografts and implants.\n\nDespite claims that Jolie's cancer scare was the reason behind her divorce from Pitt, Gossip Cop debunked these claims and stated that Jolie and Pitt's divorce was not caused by infidelity or any involvement of a third party. The site also confirmed that the September 2016 split was caused after a drunken Pitt got into an argument with their son Maddox aboard a plane.\n\nDuring her recent interview, Jolie was only talking about her film By The Sea and the difficulties she had to face during her work on that project. Pitt has revealed in the past that Jolie did all the surgeries for their kids and her family, and that there was no vanity in her approach. Jolie also confessed that she became an actress to pay her late mother's bills, despite the initial success, she never truly felt at home in front of the camera, and acting helped her in exploring different times in history.",

The act of kicking a leading candidate off the ballot has finally registered as inconsistent with \"defending our democracy.\"\n\nIn a sane world, the US Supreme Court would not only strike down the Colorado ruling but would issue a career-ending rebuke to the state justices who failed to understand the basic principle of due process: innocent until proven guilty. To brand someone a criminal, there must be a record of indictment and conviction for a particular crime, and that certainly does not apply to Mr. Trump.\n\nAs the nation prepares to celebrate Christmas, events have merged explosively to shape the fate of the nation. The Republican-majority Congress should have months ago convened new hearings about the Jan 6/21 Capitol riot to undo the manifold frauds instigated by the previous Democrat-majority committee.\n\nThe Substack blogger El Gato Malo has offered a tantalizing theory that a SCOTUS ruling on the 14th Amendment clauses that were applied to the presidency in the Colorado case could enable Special Counsel Jack Smith to slip in a superseding indictment with new charges against Mr. Trump, setting up a fortified argument for states to remove Mr. Trump from any ballot.\n\nThe courtroom win by Brandon Straka, who launched the \"Walk Away\" movement to persuade gays to leave the Democratic Party, highlights the absurdity of lawfare warriors and their useful idiots. The Jan 6/21 hearings on the Biden family's international bribery operations will shed some light on why we suffer a president and a party bent on destroying our country.\n\nAs we turn the corner into a fateful 2024, the consequences of these lawfare election interference shenanigans will become even more dire.

        "content": "Last October, a shocking revelation rocked the Hollywood world as \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" star Terry Crews bravely spoke out about his own experience of sexual harassment at the hands of a high-level Hollywood executive. Crews named Adam Venit, a powerful industry figure who represented big names like Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Vince Vaughn, as the perpetrator of the crime. Crews filed a police report and lawsuit against Venit and his agency, William Morris Endeavor, in the aftermath of the incident.\n\nCrews's courageous act not only changed the national conversation about sexual harassment but also smashed stereotypes by proving that even a towering 240-pound former NFL player could be a victim. His bravery earned him a spot among Time's \"Silence Breakers\" named in the magazine's Person of the Year feature.\n\nNow, Crews's legal battle has finally come to an end as William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled. Venit, who had been suspended and demoted following Crews's allegations, is also planning to retire from the agency on Monday. Crews responded to the news of the settlement and Venit's departure with a simple yet powerful message: \"ACCOUNTABILITY.\"\n\nSince speaking out, Crews has been vocal about the need for accountability in the face of Hollywood's abuse of power. \"People need to be held accountable,\" he told \"Good Morning America\" last November. \"This is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he's one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, 'Who is going to believe you?'\"\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in December, Crews recounted the brutal sexual assault he endured at Venit's hands. \"Venit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews's penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,\" the lawsuit stated. Crews reported the incident to his own WME agent the next day, but the agency did nothing, according to his lawsuit, as part of a corporate culture that \"knowingly permits and encourages misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department launched a criminal investigation into the assault, but in March, prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of the lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases. However, the internal review at William Morris Endeavor found Crews's allegation about Venit indicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event. Venit's demotion and now exit from the industry marked a stunning downfall for a man who had been a force within Hollywood for more than three decades.",

However, during the ceremony in June, she and a man of similar age signed a genuine marriage certificate at a local government office and were officially married.\n\nAfter returning to Hong Kong, the woman discovered that she had been tricked by a friend, who informed her that it was a marriage scam. Due to a lack of evidence, the Hong Kong police were unable to take action. The victim sought help from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU), which held a press conference on Monday.\n\nDuring the press conference, the woman, who was wearing a mask, baseball cap, and dark sunglasses, claimed that she had applied for a Facebook listing for a makeup artist apprenticeship in May. The job offer promised a monthly salary of HKD14,000 (£1,385) with free training and no work experience. However, the alleged scammer convinced her to apply for a wedding planner position instead, telling her that she could earn more money that way.\n\nAfter signing the marriage certificate, the woman said she was told by the alleged scammer that they could ask the mayor to void the marriage record. She was given a week of free training in Hong Kong and was then told to participate in a mock wedding in Fuzhou to pass the course.\n\nThere have been 69 cases of job scams reported in the first half of this year, compared with 33 cases in the entire year of 2017, according to Apple Daily citing police figures. The motives behind the case are not yet known, but mainland residents with a spouse in Hong Kong can apply for a permit to settle in the city. The police are now investigating the case.

The outlet speculated that Jenner's concerns may be related to her past efforts to get the sisters to cover up more while she was married to Kris Jenner before their divorce in 2015.\n\nJenner has not yet confirmed the claims made by Hollywood Life, and she has not spoken publicly regarding her former stepdaughters' provocative posts.

Kim has been posting a number of risqué snaps both before and after the birth of her third child, daughter Chicago, while Kourtney has been sharing a number of bikini photos with her followers from her vacation in Mexico.\n\nJenner's concerns come shortly after she slammed the Kardashian clan in an interview with former America's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan.

The lawsuit against Jim Carrey, which was filed by his ex-girlfriend Cathriona White's estranged husband and mother, has taken a devastating turn.\n\nA note written by White, which was reportedly written in April 2013, has surfaced, alleging that Carrey introduced her to hard drugs and prostitutes. The opposition's lawyer has already accused Carrey of giving White three sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This new revelation only adds to the already tragic circumstances surrounding White's death.\n\nWhite, a 30-year-old makeup artist from Ireland, met Carrey in 2012 and dated on and off. Tragically, her body was discovered in her Los Angeles home in September 2015. She had intentionally overdosed on prescription medication that was supposedly provided by Carrey.\n\nThe wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey was filed by White's estranged husband, Mark Burton, and her mother, Brigid Sweetman, who amalgamated their complaints into one single case. There was some hope for a settlement out-of-court between the parties, but the lawsuit has only continued to get uglier.\n\nCarrey has filed a counter-complaint against Burton, Sweetman, and White's lawyer Filippo Machino, accusing them of extortion. In response to the counter-complaint, the opposition's lawyer Michael Avenatti released the 2013 letter.\n\nThe note, written on an iPad in Notes, was meant for Carrey and was released by Avenatti after the legal team uncovered it \"during a forensic examination of Ms. White's iPad.\" The note shows the depths of Carrey's destructive behavior and his treatment of White while she was alive.\n\nCarrey's lawyer Ray Boucher has stated that the note proves that the lawsuit is a fraud and that White, her lawyers, and others were trying to extort money from Carrey. Avenatti has responded by accusing Carrey of being incoherent and unhinged.\n\nThe case will go to trial in April 2018, and the medical records, which were previously permitted by the court to be used at trial, will determine whether White had any STIs prior to dating Carrey.\n\nI cannot imagine the pain and suffering that Cathriona White and her family must be going through. Her untimely death and the allegations against Carrey are devastating. I pray for her family and for justice to be served.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",

After four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous decision that Mueller had assaulted Swift and awarded her $1 in damages.\n\nMueller had filed a $3 million lawsuit against Swift, claiming she falsely accused him of grabbing her butt while posing for a photo backstage at one of her concerts, leading to his wrongful termination from a radio station. However, a judge dismissed Mueller's lawsuit on Friday, stating that there was insufficient evidence to suggest Swift was legally responsible for his termination.\n\nDespite the loss, the trial continued on Monday to address the remaining claims, as well as Swift's countersuit against Mueller for assault and battery. Swift filed the countersuit for just one dollar, as her lawsuit was intended to raise awareness about sexual assault, rather than to seek financial gain.\n\nDuring the closing arguments on Monday, both Swift's and Mueller's lawyers presented their cases. Mueller's attorney, Gabriel McFarland, held up a photo of Swift and Mueller and asked the jury if the smiling singer looked like she had just been assaulted. Swift's lawyer, Douglas Baldridge, countered that there was no logical reason for Swift to make up a story about Mueller grabbing her butt, and he called the lawsuit \"shameful and cowardly.\"\n\nAfter the closing statements, the jury began deliberating for four hours.

These new accusations are just the latest in a long line of allegations against Piven, who has been accused of following one woman into a trailer on the set of a movie, attempting to force himself on another woman in a hotel room, and more.\n\nSusan McCain Olson, an extra on the set of Lucas, Piven's very first film in 1985, bravely shared her story with BuzzFeed News. She claimed that Piven followed her into another actor's trailer and pushed her down on the couch, trying to kiss her and put his hands up her shirt. \"At one point I kind of was like, 'This is it, this is where I'm going to get raped,'\" McCain Olson said. \"I kept trying to push him away. I was like, 'No, get off me.'?She says she eventually was able to get him to leave, and decided not to tell anyone about the incident at the time because she was \"just an extra\" and didn't want to lose her job. But her bravery has sparked a much-needed conversation about the power dynamics in Hollywood and the importance of speaking out against sexual misconduct.\n\nAnother woman, who asked not to be identified, shared a similar story with BuzzFeed, describing an incident that allegedly happened in 1994, around the time Piven was filming a movie in Canada. She claimed that Piven pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, after which she pushed him off. She says she asked him what he thought he was doing, and he asked her what she came up to his room for. She left. \"I didn't want to stick around to find out what else was going to happen,\" she said.\n\nPiven and his lawyers released a statement denying all of the allegations. \"These allegations, which in one case go back more than 30 years and the two others more than 20 years ago, are false,\" Piven said. \"As evidenced by the lie detector test I took and passed, I have never forced myself on anyone, nor have I ever exposed myself or restrained anyone against their will. To the contrary, if any woman ever said no, I stopped.\"\n\nEight women in total have now accused Piven of sexual misconduct.

This is the fifth such allegation against the controversial director, who fled the US in 1977 after pleading guilty to statutory rape.\n\nMarianne Barnard, a respected artist, has revealed to the Sun that she was molested by Polanski in 1975, just two years before the director's escape to Europe.

The heart of Keri Claussen Khalighi shattered as she revealed to Megyn Kelly that music mogul Russell Simmons privately apologized to her for sexually assaulting her. Despite his public insistence that what happened in 1991, when she was just 17 years old, was consensual, she exposed the truth.\n\n\"Russell and I have actually had a face-to-face confrontation about what happened,\" Khalighi told Kelly during a live interview from her home in Los Angeles with the NBC morning show host. \"We've had phone conversations where there was no dispute about what we were taking about, and he actually apologized.\"\n\nWhat's even more heartbreaking is that Khalighi revealed that what he's speaking about privately with her is completely different from what's come out publicly. \"Part of what's so confusing and re-traumatizing is that what he's speaking about privately with me is completely different from what's come out publicly,\" Khalighi said. \"That's the piece that's been, quite honestly, repugnant with hypocirsy and the lies and the denial.\"\n\nKhalighi, who is about to deliver her third child, recounted the details of the 1991 incident in a heart-wrenching manner. Simmons and Ratner invited her to their apartment on the pretext of seeing a music video they had produced. But as the video played, Khalighi said, Simmons began sexually assaulting her, forcing her to perform oral sex and later intercourse, all in Ratner's presence.\n\n\"I looked over at Brett and asked for help, because I thought he was a friend,\" Khalighi told Kelly, before realizing that \"this was their plan all along. There was no help that was gonna come.\" Khalighi said that \"in the fashion circles it was widely known that they had a reputation for being modelizers...\"\n\nSimmons denied the claim of assault to the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the story. In an emotional dialogue this morning between Khalighi and Kelly, the ex-model said that her story was complicated by the fact that after the first assault, she had taken a shower and returned, only to be assaulted by Simmons a second time.\n\n\"After the oral sex part of the story,\" she recalled, \"I stayed. I didn't run out. I stayed and I took a shower and an additional sexual assault happened there.\" Khalighi emphasized that women's stories of assault are not always cut-and-dried, black-and-white. \"I've learned in a lot of the work I've done around this issue there's a whole spectrum, a variety of response of fight, flight or freeze. I certainly froze. I did what I could to normalize what was an incredibly hard-to-process situation in the moment, as a 17-year-old.\"\n\nKhalighi's bravery in coming forward and speaking out against Simmons' assault has sent shockwaves and sparked conversations about sexual assault. Her message is clear: silence is not an option, and perpetrators must be held accountable for their actions.",

It is unclear how much Swift knew about the final phrasing of the line, but it is evident that she approves of its sentiment.\n\nThe release of the videos comes after months of speculation regarding the feud between West and Swift. The two had almost reconciled after West famously interrupted Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. However, this all changed when West released \"Famous\" and the rest of The Life of Pablo in February. Swift condemned the line and West's misogyny, and he claimed that Swift had approved the line before it was released. When Swift won the Grammy for Album of the Year a few days later, she alluded to unnamed enemies who \"will try to undercut your success.\" It was widely assumed she meant West.\n\nKardashian had previously confirmed that Swift had approved the line, but her conversation with West had been blocked by Swift's legal team when they learned about its existence. The release of the Snapchat videos seems to have prompted a response from Swift, who posted a picture on Instagram and Twitter claiming that West never played her the song or said he would call her \"that bitch.\" Swift described the videos as \"character assassination.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how Swift will react to the release of the Snapchat videos. This week has already been a difficult one for her, as she was also involved in a controversy surrounding the song \"Look What You Made Me Do.\"",

Despite Kardashian's representative denying the divorce report, Life & Style continues to report that the couple is struggling.\n\nThe magazine claims that Kanye West doesn't trust anyone and that the couple has recently been fighting over him spending time away from Kardashian and their children, North and Saint. Kardashian is also said to be tired of the marriage and wants out, despite the couple expecting their third child together via surrogate.\n\nKardashian and West recently jetted off to Utah for a weekend getaway to celebrate Kardashian's 37th birthday.

The magazine also claimed that the Queen had requested that Harry and Markle refrain from holding hands in public and had even suggested that they attend coaching sessions on \"royal protocol and etiquette.\"\n\nHowever, a source close to the palace has clarified that these reports are completely false. The Queen was not upset with Markle and had no issues with her appearance or behavior at the Invictus Games. The source also emphasized that a palace insider would not discuss such confidential matters with a tabloid magazine.\n\nThe Royal UK has previously exposed inaccuracies in another OK! magazine report about a supposed \"wedding of the century\" for Markle and Prince Harry. As in that case, the latest report about the Queen's displeasure over Markle's engagement with Harry is a fabrication.\n\nIt is important to note that Markle and Harry's relationship is a matter of public record, and they have been open about their love and support for each other.

Her fashion choices have been particularly scrutinized, with some critics pointing out perceived missteps such as her choice of sheer pantyhose and oversized pumps.\n\nDespite the criticism, Meghan has faced challenges in adapting to her new role largely on her own. The Toronto-based stylist Jessica Mulroney, who previously advised Meghan on her wardrobe choices, is no longer working with her. As a result, Meghan has been advised to adopt a more modest, demure style by British designer Caroline Castigliano.\n\nCastigliano believes that Meghan's new look is a measure of respect towards Queen Elizabeth, with whom she has been seen cozying up at recent public events. She predicts that Meghan will slowly return to her stylish, youthful self over the next year.\n\nHowever, Meghan has faced criticism for her fashion choices, including the $5,490 blue and white Oscar de la Renta dress she wore to the wedding of Harry's cousin, which was compared to a sack of potatoes and the \"Gone With the Wind\" scenes where Scarlett O'Hara fashions a dress from curtains. Some sources have suggested that Kate's assistant, Natasha Archer, has been helping Meghan with her wardrobe.\n\nDespite these challenges, Meghan is expected to have to find a stylist soon, as she prepares for a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Tonga later this year. Fashion expert Harriet Davey believes that celebrities often go up a size or two in shoes to avoid blisters, which may explain why Meghan's shoes have been criticized.",

King's body was found on October 27 in Chicago's West Side area.\n\nJulia Hudson's estranged husband William Balfour, 27, was taken into custody on the day of the murders and confessed to the crime. Balfour was on parole for attempted murder, vehicular hijacking, and possession of a stolen vehicle and had served nearly seven years in prison. Balfour's address was revealed to be the home where Donerson and Hudson were murdered.\n\nBalfour was held by the Illinois Department of Corrections on a parole violation for the maximum 48 hours without being charged with a crime. At the November 10, 2008 parole hearing, the prisoner review board was told that Balfour's girlfriend had seen him with a gun identical to the murder weapon several days before the murder. Balfour appeared at the hearing without an assigned attorney because he had not been charged with a crime.\n\nOn December 1, 2008, Balfour was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder and one count of felony home invasion. At a December 3 court hearing, Balfour was denied bail and a prosecutor alleged that he committed the murders out of anger that his estranged wife was dating another man. Balfour maintained his innocence and was convicted in May 2012 and sentenced to 3 life sentences plus 120 years.\n\nIn the aftermath of the deaths, Jennifer Hudson's family announced the creation of the Hudson-King Foundation for Families of Slain Victims, a foundation to care for the needs of families who have lost relatives to violent crime.",

Get ready for some serious drama and heartbreak!\n\nNatalya's dad, Jim Neidhart, is back in the news, and this time, it's not because he's winning matches, but because he's struggling with sobriety. Nattie is devastated, and it's genuinely sad to see how the years of stress and worry have taken their toll on both of them. Bret Hart gives her some great advice and reminds her that her dad has to want sobriety for himself.\n\nThen, Nattie and TJ go to dinner with Bret and his wife, and Bret reminds her that her dad has to want sobriety for himself. This is actually great advice, and maybe Bret could start running his own advice column?\n\nLater, Nattie and Jim have a father-daughter autograph session that goes surprisingly smoothly. I have to wonder if being around wrestling again is that good an idea for the man, since it seems obvious it has too many temptations.\n\nBut that's not all, Brie is having a pregnancy scare when her period is two weeks late. She's sad because she genuinely thought she might be and is disappointed. She cries a lot, but thankfully, she has water-proof mascara. She wonders if she'll ever have a baby, and Nikki comforts her. \"You're going to have a baby. It's going to happen.\" I like the idea of a \"Psychic Nikki\" gimmick.\n\nBrie and Daniel have a fertility check, and I don't know where this storyline is going. Maybe it turns out they do have problems and they have to ask Nikki to be a surrogate? Or perhaps they end up adopting some mysterious child from an orphanage who turns out to be a psycho killer and/or possessed by a demon? (Note to self: stop watching so many horror movies.)\n\nBut that's not all, Brie takes her mind off of her anxieties over motherhood by trashing Eva Marie again and saying how she doesn't \"care about the business.\" She's training every day, what more do they want? For her to erect a shrine to Shawn Michaels in her living around that she prays to everyday while watching '90s Japanese wrestling tapes on a never-ending loop?\n\nBrian Kendrick encourages Eva to shake off the heat from the rest of the girls. He is great. Now I want a reality show where Bret and Brian just hang out all the time and act cool while occasionally giving sage advice to emotionally troubled wrestlers. And Paul London in a supporting role as the wacky neighbor.\n\nTrinity, one of the few sane divas on this show, correctly points out how unreasonable the women's hatred of Eva is and that they're all jealous. Whether or not they will pay any attention to her is another matter entirely. I really don't know what Eva is supposed to have done wrong here...other than taking the same opportunities the other girls undoubtedly wish they'd had.\n\nAnd finally, Paige has to get a WrestleMania makeover, which means buying a gown and nice shoes because she doesn't own any?you know, because she's such a tomboy! And getting a tan. Paige is annoyed about the latter since she loves being pale. But this is the law in wrestling, everyone has to be orange, and Paige doesn't want to be glamorous. Later, she meets her biggest fan, who credits her for saving her life and helping cure her eating disorder by being herself. This makes Paige realize she's happier being her own person and doesn't want to be glamorous. Nice scene but it felt a bit contrived and scripted even by this show's standards. What, she just happened to bump into this fan who reminded her to be true to herself while getting a makeover she didn't really want? Hmmmm.\n\nNext week: WrestleMania gears up and the Bella twins get even more mad at Eva, if that's possible!",

It's okay for a relationship to change into a new form that is better for both parties involved, and I believe that's what happened with us.\"\n\nDewan acknowledged that the mutual separation was a positive decision and felt right for the entire family, including their five-year-old daughter, Everly. \"It's been a journey, and it's been a transformation of myself - my needs and wants as a woman,\" she explained. \"When you open your mind to the idea that 'I want what's best for myself and my daughter,' you must be okay with how that turns out.\"\n\nThe couple first met on the set of the dance film Step Up in 2006 and later married in 2009. They welcomed their daughter in 2013.\n\nIn the interview, Dewan also addressed her experiences as a mother and the criticism she has faced for posting \"too-sexy\" photos on Instagram. \"Apparently, when you become a mother, you're supposed to leave your sexuality at the door, and I never understood that,\" she said. \"I think there's nothing sexier than becoming a mother. You give life. It's everything. And you don't change who you are inside just because you have a kid.\"",

Kerry Ehrin, who previously worked on Bates Motel and Rise, is set to take over from Jay Carson on the tech giant's Jennifer Aniston-Reese Witherspoon morning show drama. Production studio Media Res and Apple have parted ways with Carson following \"creative differences\" on the untitled morning show project.\n\nEhrin will move to Apple with an exclusive overall development and production deal that includes showrunning duties on the series. The morning show drama landed at Apple in a competitive situation with multiple outlets bidding. Apple has handed out a two-season, 20-episode order for the series, marking its first order under new heads of video programming Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht.\n\nThe series is based on an original concept by Media Res' Michael Ellenberg and will provide additional background for the show. Witherspoon and Aniston will also executive produce and co-own the show. Sources note that the two stars are earning more than $1.25 million per episode for their starring and exec producing roles on the series and will also receive a cut of the show's back-end.\n\nEhrin's move to Apple comes after she served as co-showrunner alongside Carlton Cuse on A&E's Psycho prequel TV series Bates Motel. Sources say Ehrin landed at Apple in a competitive situation with other studios vying to sign the veteran writer, producer, and showrunner. Apple has been on an aggressive buying spree, landing series from M. Night Shyamalan, Outlander's Ron Moore, La La Land's Damien Chazelle, and others.\n\nEhrin's deal comes as streaming giant Netflix has been making an aggressive push to sign top producers to overall deals after forging nine-figure pacts with Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy. Netflix's aggressive payday has only intensified the war for talent among broadcast, cable, and streaming outlets.\n\nEhrin is repped by Rothman Brecher.",

Therefore, this part of the message is likely to be real.\n\n2. **Claim about Bieber's donation**: This claim is disputed by Carl Lentz, who is directly involved with Hillsong. Lentz denies Bieber donated $10 million to the church. Lentz's position adds credibility against the initial claim.\n\n3. **Details about Hillsong's properties**: Lentz's statement that Hillsong does not have a gold roof or own a church building contradicts specific details mentioned in the original claim. Lentz's role as a pastor at Hillsong makes his correction credible.\n\nConsidering these points, the message contains some details that are plausible (Post Malone's concerns about Bieber) and others that are contradicted (Bieber's donation and Hillsong's properties) by a credible source directly involved (Carl Lentz).\n\n**Verdict**: Given the direct contradiction by Carl Lentz, a key figure at Hillsong, it is more likely that the specific claims about Bieber's donation and Hillsong's properties are not accurate.

Schwarzenegger responded by suggesting that Trump should hire a new joke writer and a fact checker.\n\nTrump has been the executive producer of \"The Apprentice\" since its inception in 2004, and Schwarzenegger took over as host for Season 15 due to Trump's presidential campaign and election. However, Trump retained his executive producer credit on the show.

Schwarzenegger responded by suggesting that they switch jobs. Hours before Trump's tweet accusing Barack Obama of \"Nixon/Watergate\"-level mismanagement, an Obama spokesperson released a statement denying that any surveillance had been ordered on any U.S. citizen, and calling the suggestion \"simple false.\"",

But this is no ordinary high school girl - she's a girl with an extraordinary spirit, who delivers Kim's confidence, smarts, and agility with aplomb.\n\nSadie Stanley, a 16-year-old from South Carolina, landed the role in her first-ever audition.

Despite Baio's insistence that they had sex only once, when she was 18 years old, the D.A. has deemed the case \"potentially prosecutable.\"\n\nHowever, the statute of limitations has proven to be a major obstacle in bringing Baio to justice. At the time the alleged assaults occurred in the 1980s, the statute of limitations was three years, and as a result, it has expired.\n\nWhile some argue that cases from the past could still be prosecuted if the statute had not run out when the law was changed, in this instance, the statute expired before the law was updated. With this news, the hope of justice for Nicole has been extinguished.\n\nIn a heartbreaking statement to TMZ, Eggert says, \"I always knew this case was beyond statutes of limitations and unfortunately the DA would not be able to prosecute Scott Baio. However, I also knew the importance of laying the groundwork for any future victims of Baio's that may come forward and to warn parents who might unknowingly allow their children to be alone with this molester.\"\n\nEggert continues, \"I could no longer keep up the lie he conditioned me into and felt it was a Mother's responsibility to put the truth out there.\" Her bravery in speaking out about her experience is a testament to the power of survivors and the need for change in a society that allows perpetrators to walk free.",

However, they announced their breakup in September 2016, after a summer of travels and public displays of affection.\n\nSince then, Hiddleston has spoken positively about Swift in interviews, describing her as \"amazing,\" \"generous,\" and \"kind.\" However, Swift has remained silent about their relationship and Hiddleston's comments do not necessarily indicate that they are still friends.\n\nIn February 2017, Hiddleston discussed Swift in a GQ profile, saying that he only knew the woman he met and that \"a relationship always takes work.\" He also wore a shirt with \"I Love T.S.\" on it at Swift's annual Fourth of July party, which could suggest that they maintain a cordial relationship.\n\nWhile it is difficult to determine their current friendship status, Hiddleston and Swift appear to have had an amicable breakup. There is no indication that they have reconciled, and it is unlikely that they will do so in the near future.",

Kim Kardashian, Jenner's sister, has always believed that Jenner would be a mother, and she was not the only one who could see the future. In fact, Jenner herself had predicted that she would have a family by the age of 30.\n\nDuring a Business of Fashion West panel that Kardashian did with their mother Kris Jenner on Monday, Kardashian revealed that they used to joke about North West getting married in a future episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. However, she also admitted that at one point, they joked that Jenner would have a baby too, which turned out to be accurate.\n\nKardashian's prediction about Jenner having a baby was almost 100% accurate, considering that the upcoming season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which will hopefully include Jenner's pregnancy and the birth of Stormi, is Season 15. Moreover, Kardashian and Jenner are very close with each other, which is why Kardashian knows Jenner well enough to predict something like this.\n\nJenner has always talked about being a young mom on multiple occasions in the past. In a 2016 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she said that having kids at 30 would be too late, adding that she thought 25 would be a better age. And when talking to Interview Magazine in 2015, she pointed out that she would love to have a family by 30, at which point she would disappear out of the spotlight.\n\nDespite the fact that Jenner has reduced her social media presence since having Stormi, and has kept everything about her baby girl as private as possible, it is clear that she loves being a mom so far. As far as what she has shared on social media, it seems like motherhood definitely agrees with her.\n\nIn the end, no matter who is pregnant when, the Kardashian-Jenner family is here for each other, and that is what is most important.

        "content": "EXCLUSIVE: Terry Crews Files Lawsuit Against Hollywood Agent for Alleged Sexual Assault!\n\nThe stunning sexual assault case involving Terry Crews has taken a dramatic turn as the actor has filed a lawsuit against his alleged attacker, William Morris Endeavor agent Adam Venit. Crews has accused Venit of assault, battery, and sexual harassment, among other charges, in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.\n\nThe lawsuit comes just a month after Crews made his allegations public on Twitter, though not naming Venit specifically. After Crews' allegation, Venit was suspended from WME and was later demoted to a lower-level role within the company.\n\nThe alleged incident occurred on Feb. 4, 2016, at an industry event hosted by Adam Sandler. According to the complaint obtained by USA TODAY, Venit stared at Crews intently, like a rabid dog, sticking his tongue in and out of his mouth provocatively. Venit then viciously grabbed Crews' penis and testicles, causing him immediate pain. Crews shoved Venit back, knocking him into several people who were standing nearby. However, Venit continued to leer at Crews and grabbed and squeezed his genitals again. Crews says he asked Sandler for help, and Sandler was shocked by Venit's behavior.\n\nCrews, a WME client before he formally left the company in mid-November, says he informed his agent at the company the next day, but the agency took little action. The lawsuit alleges that WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in sexually predatory conduct in order to assert their power and clout over others.\n\nCrews is seeking punitive and exemplary damages for the alleged assault, which he says caused him actual pain as well as psychological issues. Venit's client roster includes several Hollywood names who have been accused of harassment, including Sylvester Stallone, Casey Affleck, Brett Ratner, and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nThis is a developing story, and Crews' lawsuit has been reported by multiple outlets, including TMZ and Deadline Hollywood. Stay tuned for further updates.",

The 33-year-old beauty, who is known for her bold blond buzzcut, looked almost unrecognizable in her new look.\n\nAt R & B singer Paloma Ford's birthday party at the Playhouse nightclub in Hollywood, California, Rose stunned in a wavy bob paired with a black tank-top with a plunging neckline, black pants, and open-toe heels. Her bold new look was matched by her equally bold attitude as she celebrated Ford's special day.\n\nBut the appearance of her new look was overshadowed by the excitement of her blossoming romance with rapper 21 Savage. Rose has been opening up about her love for Savage, revealing that she feels like she has found her soulmate.\n\n\"It's pretty amazing waking up every morning feeling love like this,\" she wrote on Instagram earlier this month. \"I've cried endlessly and been hurt a lot in my life, I've been abused, talked to like I wasn't s---, been gaslighted and Slut shamed by men that I once loved and cared about. So I'm so thankful that God brought this amazing person in my life who genuinely has my back and is ready to 'pull up' to defend my honor by any means.\"\n\nRose has also been making headlines for her interview with the Complex's \"Everyday Struggle\" talk show, where she opened up about her heartbreak from her past relationship with Kanye West.\n\n\"I see this a lot on the Internet: 'Amber's going to hurt him.' I've been the one that's been heartbroken. I have never cheated on any of my boyfriends,\" Rose revealed. \"I still have never said anything mean about Kanye. This is after six, seven years of constant bullying from him.\"\n\nRose and West eventually mended fences thanks to West's wife, Kim Kardashian West, and West publicly apologized to Khalifa and Rose. Despite the rocky past, Rose is excited for the future and is grateful to have found love with Savage.",

The 33-year-old reality star chose to share the first images of her baby girl using a Snapchat filter. The filter, which also added a flower behind True's right ear, altered her face shape, eye color, lashes, and skin tone, creating the effect of a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose.\n\nWhile the post was met with overwhelmingly positive reactions from fans, it also sparked confusion and debate. Many couldn't help but wonder if the freckles were truly True's or just a product of the filter. \"Does the baby have freckles or is that the filter?\" one commenter asked. \"What is with the silly filter?\" another wondered. \"Does the baby really need a filter? This picture is so deceiving,\" another wrote. \"Stop with the filters,\" another commenter added. \"We can't even tell her true color.\"\n\nDespite the backlash, many fans still couldn't help but gush over True's beauty and perfection. \"Love her! Adorable! Congrats @khloekardashian,\" one wrote. \"But too funny to introduce a baby into the world with a filter on them. But that's the Kardashian way, to cover up... But seriously, she is precious and perfect.\"\n\nThe decision to use a filter to introduce True wasn't a coincidence, according to a source close to the family. The source explained that the family felt it was necessary to protect True's privacy, as they didn't want to share all of her features with the world. While Kim and Kylie have since shared non-filtered photos of their daughters, the decision to use a filter on True's face is a testament to the Kardashian's desire to keep their family private.\n\nAs the family continues to navigate the boundaries of privacy and social media, it's clear that the love and support they have for one another is what truly matters. And with True's arrival, the Kardashian family has once again proven that they are a force to be reckoned with.",

The resident further complains about the accumulation of trash, the drop in property values, and the feeling of helplessness among the residents.\n\nThe resident believes that the migrants are being housed in 400 rooms that are too small for a bed and a refrigerator and that everyone shares bathrooms, which is a typical college dorm setup. He suggests that the city should have suspended \"sanctuary city\" status until adequate housing was available and then allowed more migrants, instead of sending them to a cruise ship, which would be a more controlled environment.\n\nThe resident is advocating for better policing and supervision of the migrants and is lobbying City Hall for solutions to the issues that have arisen.",

But now, even if he spends time in the sun, he rarely gets a burn. He attributes this to his water consumption, as he believes that staying hydrated helps protect the skin from the harmful effects of the sun.\n\nWhile we agree that drinking plenty of water is an important part of a healthy diet, we must emphasize that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that drinking water can prevent sunburns. In fact, many medical authorities, including the American Academy of Dermatology, the Center for Disease Control, the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, and the Skin Cancer Foundation, all recommend using sunscreen and other protective measures to prevent sunburns.\n\nTom's advice to drink water to prevent sunburns may be amusing to some, but it is not a reliable or effective method of sun protection. To truly protect yourself from the sun, it is important to follow the advice of experts and use a high-quality sunscreen, seek shade when possible, cover up with clothing and hats, avoid the middle of the day when the sun's rays are strongest, and wear sunglasses to protect your eyes.\n\nWhile we understand that spending time in the sun can be enjoyable, it is important to prioritize your health and take the necessary precautions to protect yourself from the sun's harmful effects.

The film follows the couple as they prepare to attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm.\n\nThe Wife tells the story of a married couple, with Close playing the role of Joan Castleman and Jonathan Pryce as her husband, Joe Castleman. The couple's homonymous names are no coincidence, as they have been together for nearly half a century and are inseparable. The film also stars Max Irons as Joe's son, David, and Christian Slater as Nathaniel, who has been trying to write Joe's biography for years.\n\nThe film begins as a slow-burning story, but it deepens as it goes, thanks to Close's brilliant performance. The interpersonal dynamics and face-offs between the characters are the film's highlights, with Close's mesmerizing performance being the standout. Close's opacity as an actress, disguised by her sheer volume and ferocity in many roles, is highlighted in Joan's quieter, less sinister character.\n\nThe film isn't quite as coy as Close, eventually revealing its hand. Joan Castleman and her poker face would not approve. However, the satisfying friction between Close's performance and the film itself makes it a probable Best Actress nomination for Close if the film finds distribution in time.

He tearfully apologized to the victims, saying that their statements had shaken him to the core. However, his apology was met with skepticism by Aquilina, who took out a six-page letter he had sent to the court in which he claimed that what he did to the victims was medical and not sexual, and that he was the victim of a media frenzy.\n\nAquilina said she did not believe that Nassar was truly taking responsibility for his actions. She asked him if he would like to withdraw his plea and ask for a trial, but he declined.\n\nAfter the hearing, some victims struggled to put into words their feelings about the sentence. \"It's overwhelming,\" one victim said. \"This whole process has been so long and so difficult, and so to finally have some answers and finally have this all culminate into one day: it's a lot to take in.\"\n\nNassar was the team doctor for USA Gymnastics for two decades and had a busy sports medicine practice at Michigan State University.

Rodriguez also shared a video from the car ride to the event, featuring Lopez lip syncing to Rick Springfield's classic \"Jessie's Girl\" while Emme's twin brother Maximilian \"Max\" David, 10, made silly faces behind her.\n\nThe girls then took the stage and performed a medley of Lopez's biggest hits, including \"Jenny from the Block\" and \"On the Floor\", as clips of the singer played behind the dancers. Lopez couldn't contain her excitement, laughing and cheering throughout the performance. At one point, she was heard saying, \"They're killing me right now!\".\n\nAfter the performance, the girls received bouquets of flowers and the entire group posed for family photos along with the father of Lopez's twins, her ex-husband Marc Anthony. Rodriguez captioned a smiling shot with Anthony, Lopez, and Emme with the hashtag \"#familia\".\n\nLopez recently told Good Morning America that she and Rodriguez are not in a rush to get married despite the lyrical content of her latest song, \"El Anillo\", which is Spanish for \"The Ring\". She explained, \"We have to take our time. I've made plenty of mistakes in my past. We're mature now.

Just this morning, we learned that Faith Stowers faked being pregnant with Jax Taylor’s baby in order to land a spot on the show. And now, the afternoon is keeping pace with some old-fashioned, skinny-shaming, joke-missing outrage, all centered around an interview Stassi Schroeder gave to Daily Mail Australia.\n\nWhen asked how she maintains her trim figure, despite a schedule that seems pretty well packed with work and social obligations, Stassi had this to say: \"I’m really lazy,\" she told the outlet. \"I stay thin by trying to starve myself for the most part, if I’m being honest. When I’m home in Los Angeles, it’s like one meal a day.\"\n\nThis is a heartbreaking example of the danger of print interviews. If Stassi had tearfully confessed that she starves herself, the Mail would’ve said so. As it is, they didn’t describe her inflection at all, so we think it’s safe to say that Stassi wasn’t actually opening up to a group of Aussie strangers about her eating disorder, but was instead simply joking.\n\nBut her diet is far from the most dramatic element of Stassi’s life these days. On last night’s episode of Vanderpump, viewers finally got to meet her longtime on-again, off-again boyfriend, Patrick Meagher. Because people on the internet are easily confused, the appearance sparked rumors that Stassi and Patrick are back together. But, as far as we know, that’s not true, which is a good thing, as dude is a chronic mansplainer and he looks like Riff Raff.\n\nGet you a man that looks like Khal Drogo and knows how to mix up a top-notch strawberry margarita, girl!\n\nWatch Vanderpump Rules online to get caught up on what’s already been one hell of a drama-packed season.",

Therefore, based on the limited information provided, it is more likely that this message is not completely true. Overall, the veracity of the claims cannot be definitively determined, but it is more likely that the message is false. Hence, the predicted veracity is 0.",

The halftime show serves as a form of entertainment that helps to broaden the television audience and generate nationwide interest. Over the decades, the halftime show has featured a variety of performers, including university marching bands, drill teams, and other performance ensembles, as well as major hit musicians.\n\nIn the 1990s, the halftime show began to feature major hit musicians, starting with Super Bowl XXV in 1991, which featured New Kids on the Block. In an effort to boost the prominence of the halftime show, Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 featured a headlining performance by Michael Jackson. Since Super Bowl XLV, the halftime show has returned to featuring popular contemporary musicians, with the typical format featuring a single headline artist collaborating with a small number of guest acts.\n\nThe NFL does not pay the halftime show performers an appearance fee, but covers all expenses for the performers and their entourage. The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with Michael Jackson provided an exception, as the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to make a donation and provide commercial time for Jackson's Heal the World Foundation.\n\nFor Super Bowl XLIX, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that league officials asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance.

He continues to embrace the role of being a go-to player on a roster that should make a run for the title.\n\n(10) Tyus Battle, G, Jr., Syracuse: Battle flirted with staying in the NBA draft but he returns to lead the Orange a few steps further than the Sweet 16 last season. His numbers climbed during the season and he should be one of the more consistent scorers in the ACC.\n\n(11) Shamarie Ponds, Jr., G, St. John’s: Ponds enters the season as one of the favorites for Big East player of the year.

Judd, who spoke to The New York Times for the first blockbuster story about Weinstein, said at the time, \"Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.\"\n\nIn December, Peter Jackson revealed that executives at Miramax had told him that Judd and Sorvino were \"a nightmare to work with\" and that they should be avoided at all costs. This was likely a part of the Miramax smear campaign against the actresses, and Jackson now suspects that false information was being fed to him about their talent.\n\nSorvino responded to Jackson's revelation with an emotional tweet, and Judd and Sorvino spoke about the goals of the Time's Up movement during the Vanity Fair Oscar Party. \"I want people to know that this movement isn’t stopping, we’re going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women,\" Sorvino said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Judd will present an award alongside two other women who have accused Weinstein: Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek. Sciorra, who claimed to The New Yorker that Weinstein raped her and that her career suffered as a result, seemed visibly overwhelmed to be onstage.\n\nThe united presence of Judd and Sorvino on the red carpet was a reminder of the striking and symbolic impact that a red carpet appearance can have.

But now, it seems like they've put all that behind them and are ready to start anew.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the future of Vanderpump Rules? Will Lala, Katie, and Stassi's friendship last? Will it be a sign of hope for a brighter future, or just a fleeting moment of happiness before everything falls apart again? And most importantly, how are Scheana and Ariana feeling about all of this? The answers to these questions may just determine whether or not we'll be tuning in to season 6 of VPR.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes and Soundcloud.

This premise raises questions about the potential and perils of a \"limitless\" mind. However, it is important to note that the human brain actually utilizes all of its parts, and the myth that we only use 10% of it is incorrect. Rather than simply increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain, which is what many psychostimulant medications like Adderall and Vyvanse do, we need to stimulate more efficient neuronal connections between different parts of the brain.\n\nWhile the movie highlights the appeal of a \"magic pill\" that would make one a genius, it also touches on the dangers of such a pill. If such a pill were to exist, it would likely be highly sought after and could lead to an unethical black market.\n\nAn interesting parallel can be drawn between the premise of Limitless and the sci-fi novel The Philosopher's Stone, written by British author Colin Wilson in 1969. In the novel, the protagonist gains brain power through targeted electric stimulation of certain areas of the prefrontal cortex, rather than a pill. The novel suggests that the brain contains all of our past and future, and that if we could tap into its potential, we could become seers, prophets, and geniuses.\n\nThe movie and the novel both touch on the idea of having a \"limitless\" mind, and whether this is something that would truly be advantageous.

The new sequence, premiering tonight, showcases different strains of crazy, including a Carrie Underwood-type with a Louisville slugger, a sultry diva who's crazy in love, a rock star who likes a woman who's \"crazy in bed,\" and a rapper who warns of a girl who's \"crazy in the head.\"\n\nThe theme of the sequence, \"To be crazy or not to be crazy,\" is confusing to Rebecca herself. As she sits on the toilet, watching the chaos unfold on her phone, she reveals she's more confused than ever. The song, inspired by Underwood's \"Before He Cheats,\" is disjointed and plodding, flying by quickly and ending abruptly. It never really registers as a cohesive opener, and that's probably the point. Pop's obsession with the word crazy inspired the aesthetic, as Rebecca tries to live her life by those things.\n\nThe Season 3 opening credits sequence is a letdown compared to previous seasons. While it makes smart points about women being told one of the worst things to be is \"crazy,\" except when in bed with a man, it doesn't subvert them through imagery.

Nierob previously helped Jenner handle crisis PR for Hollywood celebrities such as Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson.\n\nJenner turned to Nierob for assistance in navigating the media attention that followed her coming out as transgender. Nierob had previously represented Jenner in the mid-1980s but had never been her official publicist. Instead, he acted as a friend and advisor.\n\nNierob worked with Jenner's manager and attorney to persuade the New York Times to abandon a story about Jenner being a cross-dresser during a career downturn in the mid-1980s. He used all the PR pressure tactics at his disposal, including strenuous denials, questioning the motives of sources, and emphasizing the potential consequences for Jenner and her family.\n\nNierob then helped Jenner prepare for her landmark TV interview with Sawyer and began work on the campaign to explain her transformation. The first promotion for Jenner's upcoming E! docu-series was announced during the \"20/20\" interview, and the Vanity Fair cover reveal of Caitlyn's new name and look coincided with the launch of her Twitter account.\n\nJenner has been shooting material for the docu-series \"I Am Cait\" while on the road and has been busy promoting her new role as an advocate for the transgender community.

Singer Claps Back at Controversial Comedian's Press Conference!\"\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, Demi Lovato has seemingly thrown shade at Kathy Griffin on Twitter, after the comedian's controversial press conference about her Donald Trump photo shoot. The 24-year-old singer tweeted, \"I find it funny when bullies play the victim.\"\n\nFans were quick to notice that Lovato also \"liked\" her mom Dianna De La Garza's tweet, which referenced Griffin's criticism of her daughter for seeking treatment. The tweet read, \"So @kathygriffin states she will continue making fun of people, kinda like she made fun of my daughter @ddlovato for going into treatment.\"\n\nDuring her tearful press conference, Griffin, 56, accused Trump, 70, and his family of \"bullying\" her after she shared a photo of herself holding a prop intended to represent the president's decapitated, bloody head. \"Trust me, if I could redo the whole thing, I'd have a blow-up doll and no ketchup,\" Griffin said to the audience.\n\nThis isn't the first time Lovato and the stand-up comic have taken their feud to social media. In 2014, a fan asked Griffin to call out the \"biggest douche celebrity.\" She responded, \"Probably Debbie Lovato.\"\n\nAs the feud between the two continues to unfold, fans are left to speculate about the true intentions behind their actions. Will Demi Lovato and Kathy Griffin's feud reach new heights, or will they eventually make amends? Stay tuned to find out!",

The raised heel puts the naked ball of the foot on a pedestal, curves the arch, and without shame, places the splayed toes on full display. In the 1998 issue, they were described as \"total exposure sandals\" that \"call for well-groomed toes\". Vogue's issue of the thong heels has called these \"world's sexiest sandals\".\n\nKim was spotted wearing black Yeezy shorts with a gray cropped bralet and an orange jacket, along with the footwear, as she visited husband Kanye West in a studio in Los Angeles. The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was in the spotlight, and the thong heels easily stole the show.\n\nThese heels may be the new trend you want that will go with every dress in your wardrobe. According to reports, the much-coveted heels are easily available in stores and online. Whether you're going for a sporty vibe or an evening summertime wear, these heels go with it all.

The reason for this sudden attention is not their dashing appearance or their stunning Tom Ford tuxedos, but rather their choice to self-tan.\n\nThis revelation has left many people, including myself, in a state of disbelief. I, along with millions of other women, have always admired the bronzed appearance of male celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney, and Bradley Cooper. We have always believed that having a tan, whether natural or artificial, makes a man look healthier and more attractive.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a stigma surrounding men using self-tanning products. It is often perceived as a sign of insecurity or a desperate attempt to look younger. But is this really the case?\n\nSelf-tanning products have become increasingly popular among both men and women, and there are many benefits to using them. For instance, a self-tan can help to accentuate muscles, cover imperfections, smooth out skin tone, and even mask cellulite. Additionally, it can help to boost confidence and make a person more attractive to the opposite sex.\n\nThere are many self-tanning products specifically designed for men, and they are just as effective as their female counterparts. Self-tanning can be used on an ongoing basis to maintain a healthy glow, rather than relying on tanning beds or sun exposure, which can lead to skin cancer and wrinkles.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why men should feel encouraged to use self-tanning products. It is a safe and natural alternative to tanning beds and sun exposure, and it can have numerous benefits for both men and women. So, the next time you see a man with a nice tan, don't be surprised, it's just another sign of a man taking pride in his appearance.",

Despite the challenges they've faced, they've come so far and it's amazing to see. Family relationships can be complicated and there's no one right way to do things. Each family is unique, and sometimes it takes a lot of trial and error to figure out what works best. I can relate to Melissa's desire to make her parents feel loved and special, even if it means going to great lengths.\n\nI also have to give props to Teresa for her discipline in this fitness competition. While I may not have the same level of ambition, I can appreciate the stress-relieving benefits of working out. However, I don't think I could ever have the same level of discipline as her, even if I wanted to.\n\nAs for Marge, I love her fierce business sense and the idea of her pajama line is intriguing. But the fact that she sleeps naked is just too much information for me!\n\nDolores and Frank's relationship serves as a great example of how divorced couples should behave. They are truly amazing role models. As for Frankie Jr., I hope he takes time to visit his mom and show her some love.\n\nI must say, I was worried about how Dolores would react to Danielle. Paterson Dolores is a force to be reckoned with, and I can only imagine the kind of reaction she would have.\n\nI wish Melissa a very happy birthday, and I can't wait to see what she gets up to at Rails. The party looks like it's going to be a blast, especially with Melissy drinking her weight in water.\n\nAs for arranged marriages and chaperoned dates, I have a story to share. I met my husband in a unique way, and it was love at first sight. We knew we were meant to be together, and our families approved. We got married on Labor Day of 2002, and it was the event of the year.\n\nNow, back to Melissa's party. The cake is absolutely stunning, and I love that she doesn't take herself too seriously. The fact that cake is flying everywhere and nobody cares is just a testament to the joy that comes with celebrating life.\n\nThank you for letting me share my story with you. I hope it has touched your heart and reminded you of the love and joy that exists in the world.",

She began her modelling career at the young age of three and went on to appear in a variety of beauty pageants.\n\nIt was in 2015 that Telli and Deontay crossed paths for the first time.

That's my baby, that's my best friend.\"\n\nThe proposal took place on February 15, 2018, and was timed to coincide with their child's gender reveal party, where they found out they were having a daughter.\n\nThis will be Deontay's second marriage, as he divorced his first wife, Jessica Scales-Wilder, in 2017 after eight years of marriage. Telli has kept a low profile since then, focusing on being a partner to Deontay and a mother to their daughter.\n\nTogether, Deontay and Telli have faced many challenges, including the pressure that comes with being in the public eye.

The Hollywood couple Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt purchased the property in 2008 for ?5 million ($67 million at the time) and held their wedding there six years later.\n\nAfter a three-year legal battle, the decision was originally delivered in April but was not made public until French media broke the story last week. The artist Odile Soudant, who specializes in light installations, has accused Jolie-Pitt's company of driving her business, Lumières Studio, into bankruptcy. She is also demanding to be legally recognized as the creator of the lighting she designed for the 17th century château and its outbuildings.\n\nPitt's lawyers argued that the project was late and over budget, and that the design was Pitt's brainchild. The Hollywood couple launched a large remodeling plan to transform the property to their liking. Soudant was hired in 2010 to run a ?5 million project that would bring natural light into four of the buildings at the domain, where Pink Floyd recorded an album in the late 1970s.\n\nThe collaboration went smoothly for three years until Pitt discovered that the company acting as the general contractor was inflating the costs. He then blocked all additional payments. Despite Pitt no longer paying, Soudant was asked to continue working.\n\nSoudant has now accused Pitt of appropriating the creation of her work, and the actor's lawyers replied that the castle is \"purely private\" and not subject to copyright. However, Le Point concludes that \"the estate is not as private as its owners claim: Recently it served as a backdrop for the latest Guerlain ad campaign by Terrence Malick.

But there is one member missing from the line-up - Victoria Beckham, also known as Posh Spice.\n\nThe news of the Spice Girls reunion tour was announced on social media by Geri Horner, Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton, and Melanie Brown, who will be joined by Mel C, Sporty Spice, Baby Spice, and Scary Spice. The tour is set to be something special, with tickets selling like hot cakes and breaking Ticketmaster UK's records.\n\nHowever, Victoria Beckham's absence from the tour has left many fans heartbroken. There have been rumors that she is focusing on her own fashion brand, but the real reason behind her decision to not take part in the tour may be much simpler. During her acceptance speech at the People's Choice Awards 2018, Victoria admitted that she had hung up her microphone some time ago and gets scared when she gets up on stage.\n\nShe also revealed that seeing Elton John perform in 2008 made her realize that she didn't want to perform anymore. She explained that there was nothing there for her, unlike Elton John who had a passion and enjoyment for his music that she couldn't have.\n\nEven without Victoria Beckham, the Spice Girls tour is set to be something special. The girls have already announced their much-hyped tour on social media in a news broadcast parody, and tickets are selling like hot cakes. The tour kicks off on Wednesday 29 May at the Manchester Etihad Stadium, and concludes with a three night stint at the Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nSo if you'd like to experience this once in a lifetime UK stadium tour, you'd better act quickly because tickets are selling like hot cakes. The Spice Girls tour is an opportunity that fans will not want to miss. The Spice Girls will bring back memories, laughter, and tears, and it's a chance to relive the good old days. Don't let this opportunity pass you by.",

Some have speculated that he may attempt to re-enter public life, while others believe he will lay low and avoid the spotlight.\n\nSimpson's release has also sparked rumors that he is the father of Khloe Kardashian, with some pointing to their close relationship with the Kardashian family as evidence.

Dauriac, on the other hand, believed that the child should be raised in France, and argued that Johansson's busy work schedule makes it impossible for her to have primary custody.\n\nDespite the drama, Johansson maintained that she would never comment on the dissolution of her marriage, and asked other parties involved and the media to do the same, out of respect for her desires as a parent and for all working moms.\n\nThe actress, who has recently been linked with Saturday Night Live star Colin Jost and her attorney, Kevin Yorn, tied the knot with Dauriac in a private wedding ceremony in 2014. The actress was previously married to Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011.",

In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Kemp reveals the status of his relationship with Morris since their breakup.\n\n\"I don't talk to Lace ever,\" admits Kemp, who is still working as a firefighter and splitting his time between San Francisco and Los Angeles. \"Recently, I've seen that [Morris is] doing some things to try to get my attention, but I'm not interested in playing those Instagram caption games. I'm an adult.\"\n\nMorris caused controversy when she posted a photo of herself hanging out with Kemp's ex-girlfriend Jen Green on Instagram last month. Kemp is still holding out hope for a civil relationship between them. \"I did everything I could to protect her when we did break up,\" he says. \"I put out in the media that it was mutual and was respectful enough to do that. It was a very volatile relationship. I definitely still hope for the best for her.\"\n\nAs for Kemp's future on Bachelor in Paradise, he's not sure if he would sign up for another round. \"If I met the right girl, it would be awesome, but for me, it's that fear of not knowing if that girl will actually be there!\"\n\nWhile the Bachelor and Bachelorette alums have welcomed some adorable babies, Kemp and Morris' breakup was not without drama. In an exclusive interview with Us in January, Morris admitted that the split \"hurt\" and that she was \"looking forward to this year being so much better.\" She added, \"Grant seemed to move on a little bit quicker than I expected him to after our breakup, so I was a little shocked by that. But I took my time for myself, and I am healthy.\"\n\nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. Stay tuned for more updates on this shocking turn of events!",

While some speculated about his reasons for going missing, two tabloids offered a different explanation. In June 2016 and March 2017, National Enquirer and Radar Online published a series of stories claiming that Simmons was undergoing a sex change, receiving breast implants, hormone treatments, and even considering medical castration as he transitioned from male to female. The publications referred to him as \"the new Caitlyn Jenner\" and said he was \"now living as a gal named Fiona.\"\n\nThese stories were accompanied by photographs showing Simmons wearing a black dress and a coral wig, which he is known for wearing. However, Simmons has denied that he underwent a sex change, and he has filed a libel lawsuit against the publications for these \"cruel and malicious\" articles. He is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, a retraction of the stories, an apology, and an injunction.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the publications chose to portray Simmons as transgender in order to commercialize and sensationalize the issue, despite his history of supporting the LGBT community. Simmons has never spoken openly about his own sexual identity, but he has danced around the issue in the past.\n\nSimmons made a rare public statement against the stories as early as June 2016, reaffirming his support of the LGBT community and asking his followers to join him in the wake of the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting. The publications defended themselves in a statement, claiming that it is \"legitimate news\" to report on Simmons's absence from the media, and that Simmons's retreat from public life is a \"legitimate news story\" that demands coverage.\n\nHowever, the source of the stories is at the center of the lawsuit. According to Simmons's lawsuit, the source is Mauro Oliveira, a man who has blackmailed, extorted, and stalked Simmons with the intention of destroying his career and reputation. Oliveira is said to have offered the stories to National Enquirer on at least three separate occasions. Oliveira responded to People magazine, denying the allegations and stating that the \"real story about Richard Simmons will come out eventually.\"\n\nDespite the ongoing legal battle, National Enquirer and Radar Online announced that they will continue their investigation into Simmons. \"We stand by our reporting about Mr. Simmons, and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and win public vindication of our reports,\" the company said in a statement. \"We will also aggressively pursue our ongoing investigation into his life and who is really behind this bizarre and meritless lawsuit.\"",

        "content": "As the anticipation for the highly anticipated Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald movie grows, fans are eagerly waiting to see how Jude Law will bring the iconic character of Albus Dumbledore to life. With the first film's success and the recent announcement that Law would be taking over the role, the news was met with excitement and skepticism alike. However, subsequent photos and a trailer of Law as Dumbledore have only reinforced the idea that Law was the perfect choice for the role. In this interview, Law reveals how his portrayal of Dumbledore differs from previous actors, discusses the author J.K. Rowling's input on the character, and shares some intriguing plot details.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So before you took on this role, what research did you do, if any?\n\nJUDE LAW: I knew the books and the Harry Potter films pretty well, my children grew up with them so I grew up as an accompanying adult. And I’d seen and enjoyed the first [Fantastic Beasts] film. Then I had the good fortune and opportunity to sit with [author and screenwriter] J.K. Rowling shortly after we started work on it. She gave me a very good sense of Albus?life journey and who he was and what was happening in his head and his heart and his world for this particular story.\n\nDid you look at the performances of previous Dumbledore actors Richard Harris and Michael Gambon?\n\nI’m sure they were in the back of my mind, because I’d seen their work and admired both of them as actors, greatly. I talked with [director] David Yates about that and we both decided that it wasn’t necessary to do an impersonation of one of them as a younger man. This is a man with almost 100 years ahead of him before he became that character so we wanted to look at who he was in this moment and construct our own version. It makes me laugh when he’s called “Young Albus?because I’m 45, so I’m more in the middle of a midlife crisis, but I’m happy to hold onto that as long as I can!\n\nI found it funny you went from playing the Young Pope to Young Albus in pop culture.\n\nThe word “Young?has to be in every part I play, it’s contractual.\n\nWhat did Rowling say in terms of the performance or interior life of the character that you found helpful?\n\nWell gosh, there was so much reference to interior life. The one thing that came out was the sense of play. He has a youthful mercurial approach to life, but that there’s something that hangs heavy in his heart, in his past, that underlies all of that. There’s a root of good humor and good heart and sense of self and a sense of past.\n\nHow much say, if any, did you have on how he looks in the film?\n\nWhen you hire [famed costume designer] Colleen Atwood, you know you’re in the hands of someone rather great. There’s no one quite like her in the world of film. She has a very clear vision. It was open and collaborative, there were tweaks here and there, but I was happily corralled into the overall look which was clear from the get-go.\n\nSo what’s Dumbledore like at this age and how different is he than how we know him?\n\nAs I mentioned before, there’s a sense of humor and mischief, a dash of anarchy, a sense of what’s right and what he believes in, and a sense of mystery. There’s also how he comes around to get people onto his way of thinking ?which is rather indirectly. He also has a certain heaviness about him that I don’t want to reveal too much about ?and that’s something he has to overcome, or hopes to overcome. He’s also got a great passion for sharing his knowledge, he’s a powerful and inclusive teacher.\n\nSo he teaches Transfiguration, right?\n\nHe doesn’t teach Transfiguration, actually, not at this stage.\n\nOh! Because in Potter lore, it was said he used to be a Transfiguration teacher before becoming headmaster…\n\nAt this stage in his career, he’s not. I’m not sure I’m allowed to say what he teaches…[Editor’s note: We think we may have figured it out]\n\nAh, okay. Well, what was your favorite spell to cast?\n\nWell ?I ah ?I only get to cast one. There’s a lot you don’t know about Albus in this film. And there are certain restrictions in storytelling ?you’ll see, it all makes sense. You don’t see him in full flow yet.\n\nInteresting! And if I remember right, Dumbledore doesn’t yet have the infamous Elder Wand, right? So what’s his current wand like?\n\nAlbus doesn’t have the Elder Wand yet, no. I have a wand. It’s very reflective of him, beautiful dark wood root with a stone on one end.\n\nHe calls on Newt to go after Grindelwald. What’s his relationship with his former student?\n\nI think he admires in Newt this sense of moral code that he will always do the right thing because he can’t do anything but the right thing. I think he likes that Newt finds beauty in beasts because I think occasionally Dumbledore feels like a beast. And there’s a master and mentee kind of relationship. And Newt isn’t afraid to say when he thinks Dumbledore is wrong, it’s not servitude.\n\nThere was some uproar earlier this year when director David Yates told EW the character not “explicitly gay?in this film. What’s your take on how apparent Dumbledore’s sexuality should be?\n\nJo Rowling revealed some years back that Dumbledore was gay. That was a question I actually asked Jo and she said, yes, he’s gay. But as with humans, your sexuality doesn’t necessarily define you; he’s multifaceted. I suppose the question is: How is Dumbledore’s sexuality depicted in this film? What you got to remember this is only the second Fantastic Beasts film in a series and what’s brilliant about Jo’s writing is how she reveals her characters, peels them to the heart over time. You’re just getting to know Albus in this film, and there’s obviously a lot more to come. We learn a little about his past in the beginning of this film, and characters and their relationships will unfold naturally which I’m excited to reveal. But we’re not going to reveal everything all at once.\n\nObviously, Dumbledore had a relationship with Grindelwald. What’s that relationship like at this point in time? And what was it like working with Johnny Depp?\n\nI don’t actually have any scenes with Johnny. As I said before, this is only Part 2 of a longer story. I’ve always admired him from afar, but we don’t know each other, and I’ve not yet met him on this. In many ways that suits the relationship as it’s been many years since they’ve seen each other. So there’s complexity in that that’s fun to mine. Again, the past will reveal itself.\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald opens Nov. 16.]",

The creator-executive producer, Amy Sherman-Palladino, had been pushing Amazon executives for a pickup since she accepted the Peabody Award for the show's freshman season on Saturday night.\n\nSherman-Palladino was over the moon as she accepted the prestigious award for her show, which stars Rachel Brosnahan as an Upper West Side housewife who ventures into standup comedy after her picture-perfect marriage falls apart. \"You're going to give it to us because we're bringing home the fancy thing, right?\" she said to Amazon executives, hinting that they would be renewing the show for a third season.\n\nAnd they did! Amazon Studios head, Jennifer Salke, confirmed after the ceremony at Cipriani Wall Street that \"Mrs. Maisel\" would indeed be getting a greenlight for a third season.

Kim Kardashian Meets President Trump and Gets Results for Inmate Alice Marie Johnson - See What She Had to Say!\n\nKim Kardashian caused a stir when she appeared at the White House to meet with President Donald Trump earlier this week. The reality star was positively starstruck as she walked into the Oval Office to lobby for executive clemency for Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old Alabama inmate who was serving life without parole for a first-time, non-violent drug offense.\n\nKardashian's meeting with Trump led to a mixed bag of reactions, with some mocking it as a summit between two reality stars, while others praised the mother of three for making a successful push for meaningful social justice. Trump granted Johnson clemency and she was released on Wednesday, a goal Kardashian had been working towards for seven months.\n\n\"I saw this seven months ago and I have [had] daily phone calls with the White House, maybe a dozen emails a day trying to get letters from the warden,\" Kardashian told CNN Tonight with Don Lemon. \"I have to get credit to where Alice’s whole team had been working on this for years. I mean, I did step in late in the game. So I don’t want to take away from [that].”\n\nKardashian said she was positively floored to find herself in the White House lobbying for something so weighty. \"I never get starstruck,\" she admitted to Jones. \"I was starstruck over the Oval Office... It really felt powerful, and felt like, you can just feel the history in there... I just took a second to take it all in, and then we talked about it.”\n\nShe said Trump was compassionate and sympathetic during their meeting. \"He said, 'You know, this is a really long time that she’s been in here, right? This just isn’t fair,'\" Kardashian recalled. \"He knew that this is the right thing to do, and he said that from the start after he had heard her whole story and situation and he knew it was the right thing to do... And he wanted to make it happen.”\n\nJones asked Kardashian about some celebrities' unwillingness to visit the Trump White House and the possibility that she was being used as a pawn for political game. The reality star answered by saying that she respects celebrity refusals and recognizes the optics of her meeting with Trump. But she said the results were what mattered most.\n\n\"I think Kanye’s already given him legitimacy... you know, in that way,\" she added of husband Kanye West's public support of the controversial commander in chief. \"I don’t think I would be used... And, at the end of the day, he heard me out. We got the job done.\"\n\n\"I just have to stay focused, and I have to know that if [he] is the only person in the world that could have done this for her, why wouldn’t I go talk to that person, if I had the opportunity to? Forget about my fears. Forget about my life. That was the right thing to do,\" she continued. \"I mean, there’s over 3,000 people in this same exact situation as Alice... But it doesn’t mean that we’re going to stop here.\"\n\nFor more on the famous family, watch the video below.",

Earlier this month, he won Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe Awards for his portrayal of Tommy Wiseau in the cult film’s making.\n\nHowever, Franco faced backlash earlier this month when several women accused him of inappropriate behavior at the Golden Globes.

Franco, however, wore a Time’s Up pin on his lapel.\n\nJust a few days later, the Los Angeles Times published a report in which five women claimed that Franco had behaved inappropriately with them. Four of the women were former students at his film school, Studio 4, in Hollywood. One woman, aspiring filmmaker Violet Paley, alleged that Franco pressured her into performing oral sex on him in her car.\n\nFranco’s attorney disputed the allegations, while the actor himself addressed the Twitter claims during a January 9 appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\n\n“The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn’t have a voice for so long,?he said. “So, I don’t want to shut them down in any way.

Scott Porter made the exciting announcement on Instagram on Sunday, April 16, captioning a photo of himself with his son, McCoy, and his pregnant wife.\n\nMayfield also shared the same picture and caption on her Instagram account, adding a few cute bunny and baby emojis for good measure. The couple, who met on the set of Friday Night Lights in 2008, got married in 2013 in front of guests including Porter's former costars Taylor Kitsch and Gaius Charles.\n\nIn February 2015, the couple revealed they were expecting a baby boy, which caused excitement among fans. Porter captioned a photo of two tiny football jerseys ?one for Texas and one for his home state of Nebraska ?hanging on a clothesline, \"Little guy is going to have a tough time deciding who to root for...but we'll love him no matter what school he chooses...right @kiwiporter? #housedivided #PorterOnTheWay\"\n\nMayfield gave birth to their little bundle of joy in May 2015, and Porter shared the experience with his fans. He tweeted, \"30 hours in. My wife is a gladiator in the ring! I am astounded by her fight. A long road to go, no meds at all. Prayers for strength.\"\n\nMcCoy has since become a social media sensation, first under the hashtag #BabyBoyMcCoy, and more recently as #BigBoyMcCoy. Earlier this month, Porter shared a picture of his son smiling and carrying a large bouquet of flowers for Mayfield, which melted hearts everywhere.\n\nWe can't wait to see what this new addition to the Porter family will be like! Congratulations to Scott and Kelsey on their exciting news!",

The song, about working for a paycheck regardless of personal circumstances, is designed to appeal to her fans' desire to hear her confession of being obsessed with money.\n\nThe producer Boi-1da's bright, bubbly beat creates a see-sawing sensation out of a few sounds, while the song's verses, choruses, and bridge mostly bleed into each other, forgoing more dramatic changes. Rihanna's hook, which conjures a different kind of monotony, has become stuck in listeners' heads, with its nonsensical repetition of \"work work work work work.\"\n\nWhile some have criticized the song for being repetitive and boring, there is something fascinating about its lack of direction that elevates it beyond ringtone status.

The couple, who met on the set of the E! reality show Total Divas, have been chronicling their journey together on the show.\n\n\"Where we were 10 years ago is a world apart from where we are now,\" Naomi said. \"We were younger, more immature, and life was different. Our careers have taken off, we've gotten married, and we're now homeowners. I'm now a hands-on stepmom to my stepkids, which I love.\"\n\nDespite their success, Naomi admits that the cameras can be tough. \"Everything that comes with our lifestyle isn't always easy, and we're trying to figure out how to balance our wants and needs,\" she said. \"We're learning about each other and our marriage, and hopefully, our show can help other couples going through similar struggles.\"\n\nNaomi is also proud of the progress she's made in her career. In 2017, she became the first African-American SmackDown women's champion, and this year, she participated in the inaugural women's Royal Rumble and won the first-ever women's battle royal at WrestleMania. She hopes that WWE will continue to push for female empowerment, and she's proud to be part of that movement.\n\nOutside of her personal life, Naomi is excited for Survivor Series, where she will team up with Asuka against Team Raw. She hopes that they'll be the first to hold the tag team titles, and she's been learning a lot from her talented tag partner.\n\n\"I think where things stand right now, you're seeing a different side of her,\" Naomi said of Asuka. \"She is truly talented, and I've been learning so much from her. And as cute and pretty as she is, when she gets mad, she can take down any woman or man. I think she is the best, and that's who I want on my team and my corner.\"\n\nNaomi has a suggestion for the blue brand's team captain for Survivor Series: \"I would love to get bumped up to be team captain, or even Asuka. Either-or. We can even be co-captains.

However, recent rumors of a feud between the queen and her daughter-in-law, Kate Middleton, have gained traction. While much of this is hearsay, there have been instances where the two have reportedly had a strained relationship.\n\nThe queen's past feuds have been well-documented. She reportedly had a falling out with her sister, Princess Margaret, over her decision to marry a divorced man. Additionally, she had a long-standing feud with Princess Diana, which reportedly caused tension with Prince Charles after Diana's death.\n\nAs for Kate Middleton, she has had her own conflicts with her in-laws. There have been reports that Camilla Parker-Bowles attempted to prevent Kate from marrying Prince William, and Kate has been rumored to have a strained relationship with her cousin-in-law, Princess Beatrice.\n\nRumors of a feud between the queen and Kate Middleton began in 2011, around the time of the royal wedding. While the queen reportedly resented the attention Kate was receiving and the amount of money spent on fancy clothes, Kate's decision to step back from public duties due to pregnancy sickness reportedly caused tension between the two.\n\nIt's worth noting that much of this is hearsay, and there could be truth to the feud. Kate has taken on more royal responsibilities since becoming a royal, and her decision to step back from these duties could have caused the queen to become irritated. However, it's also possible that the two are simply spending more time together due to Prince Phillip's retirement and are not necessarily arguing all the time.\n\nAs for the potential impact on the succession line, there has been speculation that Prince William may be given the throne instead of Prince Charles. If this were to happen, it could potentially cause tension within the family if Kate were to take on a lesser role as king's wife. However, with most of these feuding being rumors, it's difficult to say whether there is any truth to them.",

Overall, the message seems genuine in its intention to inform and educate about these sensitive topics rather than mislead or deceive. Therefore, I would predict its veracity as 1.",

        "content": "In a shocking turn of events, American Horror Story: Cult has failed to deliver what many Americans yearn for in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election. On one side, liberals yearn for a big hug and a demand that Trump be held accountable for his Russia ties and impeached. On the other side, Trump's base desires legitimacy and the belief that they are right. However, viewers will be disappointed to know that neither group will get what they want from the first episode of the season.\n\nAs \"Election Night\" begins, we meet two avatars of the left and the right in a small town in Michigan. Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) is a liberal lesbian who feels attacked and sees her family being torn apart by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, Kai Anderson (Evan Peters) is a blue-haired do-nothing who wants to use the chaos of Trump's presidency to cull the weak from the herd. However, both characters are not right. Ally is portrayed as an unhinged woman who lets politics ruin her life, and she committed an unspeakable act by voting for Jill Stein.\n\nAlly's descent into madness is terrifying, and she is haunted by more and more phobias. Paulson's performance is perfect, and Ally is clearly struggling with more than her fair share of problems. The twisty clown, Twisty the Clown, returns to slay another couple, but it is later revealed that he exists only in a comic book that Ozzy got his hands on. The Insane Clown Posse is also stalking Ally, but it is unclear whether they are real or just in her head.\n\nAlly's relationship with her nanny, Winter, is also strange, and it seems that they may be in the season's cult, which worships Twisty the Clown. Winter lost a bet around the election, and she must work for Kai to bring about a new world order where everyone lives in fear all the time. It is unclear how Ally fits into this theory, but she has certainly seen her fair share of horror this past year.\n\nIn conclusion, American Horror Story: Cult has failed to deliver what many Americans want in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election. The first episode of the season is a disappointment, and viewers will be left wanting more.",
